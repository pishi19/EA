# Ora Executive Assistant

Refactored project structure.

## Recent Changes

- **YAML/Frontmatter Fixes:**  
  - Automated and manual fixes were applied to resolve YAML/frontmatter errors in markdown files.  
  - Scripts (`auto_fix_frontmatter.py`, `build_dependency_graph.py`) were updated to handle common issues and report skipped files.  
  - Reports (`skipped_files_report.md`, `still_skipped_files.md`) were generated to track progress.

- **Dependency Graph Update:**  
  - The dependency graph (`dependency_graph.db`) is now fully up to date, with all files processed and no YAML errors.  
  - Scripts for building and summarizing the graph (`build_dependency_graph.py`, `summarize_dependency_graph.py`) are operational.

- **Next Steps:**  
  - **Analyze/Visualize:** Run graph summaries or visualizations to explore relationships and identify isolated nodes.  
  - **Automate:** Consider setting up scheduled updates or git hooks to keep the graph current.  
  - **Enrich Metadata:** Standardize frontmatter fields across notes for better linking and querying.  
  - **Documentation:** Update system docs to reflect the new workflow and error-handling improvements.
