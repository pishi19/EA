# EA System Overview

## Overview
The EA Assistant is a GPT-powered local assistant system designed to manage tasks, loops, and feedback. It uses a modular structure to organize code, tests, documentation, and configuration files.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains all Python source files, organized into subdirectories:
  - `memory/`: Memory-related scripts (e.g., vector memory, loop memory).
  - `ingestion/`: Scripts for ingesting and classifying tasks (e.g., email tasks).
  - `interface/`: User interface scripts (e.g., Streamlit apps).
  - `tasks/`: Task management scripts (e.g., routing tasks to programs).
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `gpt_supervised/`: GPT-related scripts for classification and chat.
  - `graph/`: Scripts for building and querying dependency graphs.
  - `yaml/`: Scripts for handling YAML frontmatter and metadata.
  - `loops/`: Scripts for managing loop files and updates.
  - `feedback/`: Scripts for processing feedback tags and reports.
  - `daily/`: Scripts for daily summaries and context building.
  - `tests/`: Test files for the project.

- `docs/`: Documentation files (e.g., system overview, dependency management plan).
- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for automation and setup.
- `logs/`: Log files generated during runtime.
- `data/`: Data-related files (e.g., databases, images).
- `archive/`: Archived or backup files.

## Dependency Management
The project uses `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies. Key dependencies are pinned to specific versions to ensure reproducibility. Optional dependencies for development and production are also defined.

## Logging
Logging has been implemented across key scripts to capture runtime errors and system events. The logging configuration is set to output logs in a structured format, making it easier to debug and monitor the system.

## Testing and CI/CD
The project includes a test suite and a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) to automate testing and linting on every push and pull request. This ensures that the codebase remains robust and maintainable.

## Contributing
- Follow the folder structure and naming conventions.
- Write tests for new features or changes.
- Update documentation as needed.
- Use the linter (`ruff`) to ensure code quality.
