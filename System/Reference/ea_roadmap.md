# EA System Roadmap

## Introduction

Ora is a modular executive assistant system that integrates semantic memory (Qdrant), structured logic (SQLite), and contextual awareness across signals (email, Slack, BambooHR), routing tasks into loops, projects, and dashboards inside an Obsidian vault.

### Key Components
- **Signal Ingestion**: Gmail API, iMessage, Slack (planned)
- **Memory Layer**: Qdrant (vector), SQLite (loop/task/project database)
- **Classification & Routing**: GPT-based, with confidence thresholds and trace logs
- **Feedback & Validation**: `#useful`, `#false_positive` tags, loop promotions
- **Interface**: Obsidian-driven dashboards, Streamlit UI (planned)
- **Development Flow**: Cursor-GPT pairing, with testable, modular CLI and pre-commit enforced code quality

### Signal Sources
- **Email**: Gmail API integration for task extraction and routing
- **Messaging**: iMessage support for quick task capture
- **Collaboration**: Slack integration (planned) for team coordination
- **HR**: BambooHR integration (planned) for organizational context

### Memory & Processing
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant for semantic search and similarity matching
- **Structured Data**: SQLite for loop/task/project tracking
- **Feedback Loop**: Tag-based validation and loop promotion system
- **Task Routing**: GPT-based classification with confidence scoring
