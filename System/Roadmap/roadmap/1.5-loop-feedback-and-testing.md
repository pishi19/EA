## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Introduce automated testing to validate core system behavior, begin parsing and responding to feedback signals, and establish the logic for loop promotion based on feedback and summary quality.

## ðŸ§© Scope

- Add `/tests/` directory
- Implement:
  - `test_status_writer.py`
  - `test_vault_index.py`
  - `test_insight_feedback_tags.py`
- Parse feedback tags from insights
- Establish logic for loop weighting and promotion (stubbed)

## ðŸ“‚ Linked Files

- `System/status_writer.py`
- `System/vault_index.py`
- `vault/Retrospectives/Insights/`
- `tests/test_status_writer.py`
- `tests/test_vault_index.py`

## âœ… Completion Criteria

- Tests run and pass locally
- Feedback tags identified across insights
- Promotion logic written (even if not activated)
