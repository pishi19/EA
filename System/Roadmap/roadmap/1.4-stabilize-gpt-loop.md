# ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1.4: Stabilize GPT Loop Slice

This phase ensures the GPT loop slice becomes a reliable, testable, and persistent system capability. It marks the transition from exploratory functionality to roadmap-governed execution.

## âœ… Goals

- Eliminate all hardcoded roadmap IDs or loop values
- Ensure loop-generated insights are persisted and retrievable
- Confirm `vault_index.json` updates as expected after writes
- Store `status.json` after every UI or GPT interaction
- Begin tracking active roadmap item within every interaction loop
- Prepare hooks for insight feedback and roadmap promotion

## ðŸ”§ Scope

Includes:
- loop slice rendering
- insight writing + YAML generation
- vault indexing + JSON export
- status tracking + session state

Excludes:
- Gmail ingestion
- Reflection scoring
- Promotion mechanics

## ðŸ§  Notes

This phase aligns with the architectural goal of unifying execution around the roadmap â€” enabling Ora to reason about, trace, and commit to its own phases semantically.

Every insight and file from this point forward must declare a `roadmap_id`.
