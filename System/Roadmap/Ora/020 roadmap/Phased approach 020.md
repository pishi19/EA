## **âœ… The Right Order of Priorities**

  

Letâ€™s fix this by **re-prioritizing across layers**, in the right architectural sequence.

---

### **ðŸ¥‡ 1.**Â 

### **UI First: Build a Real Loop UI Slice**

- Wire: inbox, roadmap, loop view, reflections, chat
    
- Allow: navigation, triage, read/write YAML
    
- Test: Does the UI reflect the loop system?
    

  

> Why? Without this, Ora is uninspectable. All logic is invisible and untestable.

---

### **ðŸ¥ˆ 2.**Â 

### **Link UI Actions to Roadmap Items**

- Each UI button or module ties to a roadmap item (vault/Roadmap/*.md)
    
- Could be done via loop id, frontmatter ref, or program name
    

  

> Why? This creates systemic traceability â€” what you build is what you planned.

---

### **ðŸ¥‰ 3.**Â 

### **Only Then: Introduce status.json**

- Tracks: current version, active UI mode, loaded modules, GPT model status, etc.
    
- Ingested by: Streamlit UI, Droplex daemon, logging
    

  

> Why? status.json is worthless without a stable app layer to expose.

---

### **ðŸŸ¡ 4. Introduce Feedback Summaries and Loop Scoring**

- Parse YAML for #useful, #false_positive
    
- Generate insight files from loop_id
    
- Weight roadmap items accordingly
    

  

> Why? This upgrades Ora from a viewer to a reasoning agent.

---

### **ðŸ§ª 5. Add Test Harnesses (Loader + UI)**

- test_loader.py, test_loop_parser.py
    
- Optional streamlit.testing.v1
    

  

> Why? This gives you stability and confidence to iterate quickly.
