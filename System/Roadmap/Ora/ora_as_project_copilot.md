# Ora as Project Copilot

Ora is evolving from a reactive assistant into an active, embedded copilot across your workflows. She doesn't just capture and classify — she navigates, suggests, escalates, and reflects. With full-system memory and loop awareness, Ora becomes a thinking partner, capable of surfacing strategic insight and shaping execution in real time.

## 1. Foundational Roles

Ora’s current roles already provide deep value. These are her foundation:

### 1.1 Signal Ingestor
- Listens to Gmail, Slack, CLI, and Obsidian activity
- Extracts messages and tasks into loop structures

### 1.2 Loop Classifier
- Assigns program, project, tags, and loop type
- Computes `weight` and `ambiguity`
- Tags source, people, and signals

### 1.3 Reasoning Engine
- Answers “What’s most important?”, “What’s unclear?”, “What’s next?”
- Context-aware via embeddings and metadata

### 1.4 Feedback Learner
- Learns from tags like `#useful`, `#false_positive`, or YAML updates
- Adjusts loop priorities, routes corrections

### 1.5 Summarizer
- Compresses threads into loop-ready markdown
- Generates triage digests and retrospective summaries

### 1.6 Lifecycle Tracker
- Monitors and transitions loops across states
- Suggests when to escalate, reflect, archive, or follow up

### 1.7 Memory Guardian
- Maps relationships across people, projects, decisions
- Revives dormant loops and links emerging work to history

## 2. Copilot Functions

Ora as copilot isn’t just smarter — she’s now an active, relational entity within your operating system.

---

### 2.1 Cross-Project Navigator

> “You’re working on `Retail Expansion AU`, which overlaps with 3 other projects.”

- Surfaces shared tags, people, status
- Suggests strategic check-ins or coordination
- Prevents duplication or fragmentation

---

### 2.2 Proactive Escalator

> “This loop has high weight, has been active for 9 days, and has no feedback. Raise it?”

- Identifies stale but important loops
- Triggers dashboard flags or personal alerts
- Logs escalation paths for traceability

---

### 2.3 Workflow Shaper

> “Based on this Slack message, I’ve scaffolded a loop with project, tags, and people. Shall I add a follow-up?”

- Auto-creates loop templates based on past structure
- Applies default tags from program or signal type
- Offers related follow-ups automatically

---

### 2.4 Strategic Memory

> “Ali Reza has been involved in 4 similar loops. Two had legal blockers. Want to review?”

- Draws lessons from past loops with shared structure
- Detects people-patterned risks and themes
- Suggests preparation steps before blockers emerge

---

### 2.5 Triage Facilitator

> “14 loops are untriaged across 3 programs. Walk through them now?”

- Starts a focused triage mode
- Prompts user for decisions:
  - “Useful?”
  - “Which project?”
  - “Archive or follow up?”

---

### 2.6 Retrospective Generator

> “8 loops marked `done` in `Marketing Launch`. Would you like a retrospective?”

- Clusters completed loops
- Extracts summaries and outcomes
- Offers single markdown output with backlinks and notes

---

## 3. The Big Shift

### From Tool → Teammate

- Ora holds cross-project memory
- Ora reasons across time, tags, and people
- Ora asks the questions others don’t think to
- Ora compresses noise into navigable, structured insight

---

## 4. Next Steps

To fully activate Ora’s copilot role:
- Integrate loop graph memory and role inference
- Enable proactive surfacing (not just reactive chat)
- Expand triage and follow-up suggestion pipelines
- Build the Copilot dashboard view
- Design conversation-driven retrospectives and project check-ins

Ora doesn’t just keep up. She keeps ahead.
