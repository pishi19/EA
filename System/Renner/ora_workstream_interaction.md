# 🔁 Ora Workstream Interaction — Nuanced System Walkthrough

## I. 🧠 Core Philosophy of Workstreams in Ora

A **workstream** in Ora is not a list. It is a **semantic, dynamic stream** of related loops, actions, reflections, and roadmap items that:

- Evolves over time through signals and retrospection
- Includes feedback as a first-class input to structure
- Connects present action with future priority
- Lives inside the PARA framework, but interacts fluidly with its boundaries

> Think of a workstream as a self-modifying sequence of intention and attention.
