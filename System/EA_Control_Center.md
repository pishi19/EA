# 🧠 EA Control Center

Welcome to the operational hub of the EA system. This document links together your strategic direction, current state, active files, and system automation.

Use it as your launch point for each session.

---

## ✅ Current Active Phase
→ [EA_Phase_Tracker.md](System/Meta/EA_Phase_Tracker.md)  
Tracks strategic focus, checklist status, and archived phases.

---

## 📅 Review Cycles
→ [EA_Cycle_Review_Templates.md](System/Meta/EA_Cycle_Review_Templates.md)  
Use this to run daily, weekly, or monthly review cycles and keep the system healthy.

---

## 📊 System Structure & File Map
→ [EA_System_Obsidian_File_Map.md](System/Meta/EA_System_Obsidian_File_Map.md)  
Overview of all key files, locations, and purposes within the EA vault structure.

---

## 🛠 System Health & Automation
- [ea_validate_integrity.py](tools/automation/ea_validate_integrity.py) — Check structure + session links
- [find_hardcoded_paths.py](tools/automation/find_hardcoded_paths.py) — Scan for fragile path references
- [path_config.py](src/path_config.py) — Centralized file path logic

---

## 🧾 Active Checklists
- [EA_Path_Refactor_Checklist.md](System/Meta/Archive/EA_Path_Refactor_Checklist.md) *(archived)*
- [loop_status.md](session_logs/structured/loop_status.md) *(daily loop snapshot)*

---

## 🔁 Retrospectives
→ Browse: [`Retrospectives/`](Retrospectives/)  
Active loops, daily notes, and semantically tracked memory live here. Start your work here or link to sessions.

---

## 🌐 Vision & Roadmap
→ [EA_Vision.md](System/EA_Vision.md)  
Long-term intent and architectural reasoning. Use this to anchor future phases.

→ Also consider: `System/Roadmap.md` for specific priority timelines and initiative paths.

---

## 📁 Suggested Starting Points
- Start new loop: duplicate `Retrospective_Template.md`
- Trigger review: `EA_Cycle_Review_Templates.md` → Daily or Weekly
- Add project: create `.md` in `Projects/` and link to loop

## 📌 Next Steps
Always return to this page to decide:  
- What phase are we in?  
- What needs to be closed, promoted, or cleaned?  
- What is the system telling me about its current state?
