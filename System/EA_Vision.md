# 🌐 EA Vision

This document expresses the long-term intent, guiding principles, and aspirational structure of the EA system. It is not tactical — it is conceptual.

Use this to align phases, refactor plans, and loop design with broader strategic goals.

---

## 🔭 Guiding Questions

- What kind of intelligence system am I building?
- Who is this assistant serving — and how?
- What does “reflection” mean for a machine?
- How should signal, context, memory, and judgment flow through the system?

---

## 🧠 System Design Philosophy

- **Loops are memory.** They must be reflective, editable, and weightable.
- **Signals are feedback.** They flow from the environment and must be classified and contextualized.
- **Projects are containers.** They hold executable work, not floating tasks.
- **Prompts are context.** They route signals and inform judgment.
- **Phases are intent.** They frame development in reflection cycles, not milestones.

## 🎯 Vision Statements

- The EA system should help *understand what matters* — not just log what happened.
- It should guide strategic direction by amplifying signal over noise.
- It should enable thought, not replace it.
- It should close loops, not just open tasks.

---

## 🧬 Design Patterns to Preserve

- Semantic linking between loops, projects, phases, and sessions
- Use of YAML frontmatter to drive logic and automation
- Integration of Obsidian (thinking) and Cursor (doing) with shared source of truth
- Prompts as modular units of context and classification

---

## 🛤 Where This Is Going

- A fully automated feedback-routing loop that connects email, feedback, loops, and dashboards
- A persistent, weightable memory system that drives prioritization
- An interface that allows you to *see the state of your mind* across time and reflection
