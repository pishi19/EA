# Ora Claude Integration Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

The Ora chat route (`/src/ui/react-app/app/api/ora/chat/route.ts`) has been updated to use real Anthropic Claude API calls instead of mock responses.

### What Changed:

1. **Anthropic SDK Integration**
   - Imported `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 
   - Initialized client with API key from environment
   - Using model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

2. **Enhanced System Prompt**
   - Ora now requires 4 elements: Vision, Mission, Cadence, and P&L Context
   - Warm, encouraging personality
   - Asks one question at a time
   - Provides examples when users are unsure

3. **State Tracking**
   - Monitors which requirements have been gathered
   - Passes state context to Claude with each request
   - Maintains progress through the workstream creation flow

4. **Intelligent Suggestions**
   - Context-aware suggestions based on conversation state
   - Different suggestions for each stage of the process
   - Culminates in workstream creation options

5. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback if API fails
   - Continues to work even without API key (with limited functionality)

### Testing the Integration:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   cd src/ui/react-app && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Ora:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/ora
   - Start a conversation about creating a workstream

3. **Test the API directly:**
   ```bash
   node test-ora-chat.js
   ```

### Example Conversation Flow:

**User:** "I want to create a new workstream"  
**Ora:** "Great! I'd be happy to help you create a new workstream. Let's start by understanding what area of work this will serve. Is this for customer support, product development, sales, marketing, or another function?"

**User:** "Customer support"  
**Ora:** "Excellent choice! Customer support is crucial for any organization. Now let's define a clear vision for this workstream. What specific, measurable outcomes do you want to achieve? For example, 'Achieve 95% customer satisfaction with 2-hour response times' or 'Resolve 90% of issues on first contact.' What's your vision?"

...and so on through Mission, Cadence, and P&L Context.

### Environment Setup:

The API key is configured in two places:
- **Root:** `/Users/air/Projects/ora-system/.env`
- **React App:** `/Users/air/Projects/ora-system/src/ui/react-app/.env.local`

Both contain: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api...`

### Next Steps:

- Test the natural conversation flow
- Adjust the system prompt if needed
- Add pattern learning based on successful workstream creations
- Consider adding memory/context persistence between sessions
