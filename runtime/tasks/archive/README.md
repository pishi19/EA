# Tasks Archive

## Archive Summary

**Archive Date**: 2025-06-08  
**Archive Time**: 16:30:00 UTC  
**Archive Reason**: Legacy Data Cleanup (Phase 11.3 - Project 11.3.2)  
**Total Files Archived**: 2 task markdown files  

## Purpose and Rationale

This archive was created as part of **Phase 11.3: Legacy Data Cleanup** to establish a clean foundation for the canonical artefact schema. The archived task files represent early experimental task management structures but lacked the systematic organization and metadata consistency required for the evolved Ora system architecture.

### Key Issues Identified:
- **Inconsistent task metadata structure** compared to canonical artefact schema
- **Limited integration** with hierarchical roadmap and project structure  
- **Experimental chat functionality** not aligned with current contextual chat architecture
- **Non-canonical field formats** for uuid, status, and context management
- **Missing required sections** for comprehensive task documentation

## Canonical Task Schema

Going forward, all task-related work must be integrated into the **Hierarchical Program/Project/Task Structure** as documented in `/runtime/docs/roadmap.md`. Tasks should be created as sub-components of roadmap projects rather than standalone files.

### Integration with Roadmap Structure:
- **Program Level**: Phase-based initiatives (e.g., Phase 11 ‚Äì Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering)
- **Project Level**: Logical groupings (e.g., Project 11.1: Artefact Schema and Canonicalization)  
- **Task Level**: Specific deliverables (e.g., Task 11.1.1: Design canonical artefact schema)

### Required Task Documentation Format:
Tasks should be documented as sub-sections within roadmap projects, including:
- **Clear Deliverable**: Specific outcome with measurable completion criteria
- **Status Tracking**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE, üîÑ IN PROGRESS, ‚è≥ PLANNED, ‚ùå BLOCKED
- **Dependencies**: Links to prerequisite tasks or deliverables
- **Outputs**: References to created artifacts, files, or system changes
- **Notes**: Implementation details, challenges, or contextual information

## Archived Files Inventory

| Filename | UUID | Status | Created | Context |
|----------|------|--------|---------|---------|
| task-loop-card-component.md | task-loop-card-component | pending | 2025-06-07 | Component for displaying loops with chat integration |
| task-chat-pane-update.md | task-chat-pane-update | pending | 2025-06-07 | Update chat pane with contextual functionality |

### Archived Task Details:

#### task-loop-card-component.md
- **Purpose**: Create LoopCard component with embedded chat functionality
- **Status**: Was pending implementation  
- **Context**: Part of contextual chat implementation experiments
- **Archive Reason**: Superseded by comprehensive UI architecture in Phase 11.2

#### task-chat-pane-update.md  
- **Purpose**: Update chat pane with contextual functionality
- **Status**: Was pending implementation
- **Context**: Early chat interface enhancement work
- **Archive Reason**: Integrated into broader semantic chat architecture

## Future Task Management

### Roadmap Integration Requirements:
1. **No Standalone Task Files**: Tasks must be documented within roadmap project structure
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: Tasks must belong to specific projects within defined programs
3. **Cross-Reference**: Tasks must reference related documentation, deliverables, and dependencies
4. **Status Tracking**: Progress must be tracked at task, project, and program levels
5. **Audit Trail**: Changes must be logged in execution logs and feedback journals

### Task Creation Process:
1. **Identify Program/Project**: Determine appropriate roadmap location
2. **Define Deliverable**: Specify clear, measurable outcome
3. **Document Dependencies**: Identify prerequisite tasks or resources
4. **Set Completion Criteria**: Define specific "done" conditions
5. **Update Roadmap**: Add task to appropriate project section
6. **Track Progress**: Maintain status updates and execution logs

## Migration to Current Architecture

The functionality represented by these archived tasks has been integrated into the current system architecture:

- **LoopCard Component**: Functionality incorporated into comprehensive artefact filtering and display systems in Semantic Chat Demo UI
- **Chat Pane Updates**: Chat functionality evolved into contextual chat architecture with comprehensive filtering and real-time updates
- **Task Management**: Integrated into hierarchical roadmap structure with systematic project management
