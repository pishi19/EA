## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This document captures all tasks and actions associated with the Ora roadmap slice. It serves as the collaborative planning space between user-defined actions and Ora-suggested tasks. Each entry is tracked with source, status, and optional context or reasoning. This document will evolve as both user and GPT contribute to the execution path.

## âœ… Tasks and Actions

### User-Defined Tasks

- [ ] Define phase lineage rendering in UI  
  `added_by: user`

- [ ] Review loop association accuracy across phases  
  `added_by: user`

- [ ] Confirm mutation fidelity between task cards and loop files  
  `added_by: user`

---

### Ora-Suggested Tasks

- [ ] Normalize all loop frontmatter with `phase:` and `uuid:` consistency  
  `added_by: ora`  
  `context: loop audit log`

- [ ] Add `feedback:` and `interaction:` fields to task schema  
  `added_by: ora`  
  `context: semantic loop interaction model`

- [ ] Create `## ðŸ’¬ Interaction Log` block per loop file  
  `added_by: ora`  
  `context: chat-as-execution discussion trace`

## ðŸ”„ How to Use

- Add your own tasks to the **User-Defined Tasks** section.
- Ora will suggest tasks below in **Ora-Suggested Tasks**, based on reasoning and system state.
- All tasks should include:
  - `description`
  - `added_by` (user or ora)
  - Optional: `context`, `feedback`, or `linked_loop`
- Use this file as the single truth for shared planning in the current slice.
