# Ora Alignment Protocol Reminder (Excerpt)

- No system mutation, migration, or roadmap change is legitimate unless:
    - It is rendered as a markdown file in `/runtime/docs/` or `/runtime/loops/`
    - It is cross-linked between loops and docs
    - The system-update-protocol-checklist.md has been followed
    - All changes are surfaced in the UI
- If it’s not in `/runtime/docs/` or `/runtime/loops/`, it’s not part of Ora’s system of record.

(See `/runtime/docs/alignment-protocol.md` for the full protocol.)

# [Cursor Prompt Begins Here]

**Goal:** [State the intent or mutation, e.g. "Add artefact filtering to contextual-chat-demo UI" or "Document Gmail source migration trigger"]

**Instructions:**
1. Review and follow the alignment protocol.
2. Perform the following actions:
    - [List each mutation, update, or documentation step clearly and in order]
    - [Ensure all changes are saved in the appropriate file(s)]
    - [Reference any affected loop(s) or doc(s) by filename/UUID]
    - [Update and cross-link checklist as required]
3. After all actions, **validate** that:
    - The change is present in `/runtime/docs/` and/or `/runtime/loops/`
    - Docs and loops are cross-linked and UI-visible
    - The system-update-protocol-checklist.md has been updated
    - All work remains in-band per protocol
