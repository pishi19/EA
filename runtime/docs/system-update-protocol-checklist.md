# Ora System Update Protocol Checklist

## Purpose

To ensure all architecture decisions, migrations, feedback, and major actions are captured in the canonical docs and surfaced alongside loops, preventing drift or loss of institutional memory.

---

## Checklist for Every Major System Change

### 1. Planning/Execution

- [ ] Is this action/decision part of a loop, phase, or execution context?
    - [ ] If not, create or reference the relevant loop before proceeding.

### 2. Documentation Decision

- [ ] Will this change impact system design, architecture, artefact structure, feedback, or migration?
    - [ ] If yes, update the relevant doc(s) in `/runtime/docs/`:
        - [ ] `architecture-decisions.md` for pivots and system rules
        - [ ] `migration-log.md` for any data/schema changes
        - [ ] `feedback-journal.md` for lessons learned or significant insights
        - [ ] `system-design.md` for updates to architecture diagrams or descriptions
        - [ ] `roadmap.md` for changes to roadmap or phases
        - [ ] `source-integrations.md` for new/modified external source integrations

### 3. Update Process

- [ ] Use ChatGPT to generate the new section or entry.
- [ ] Download and save the updated markdown file(s) to `/runtime/docs/`.
- [ ] Commit the change to your version control.

### 4. Loop/Doc Cross-Reference

- [ ] Link the doc entry in the relevant loop's execution log or memory trace.
- [ ] Link the loop (by filename or UUID) in the system doc entry for traceability.

### 5. UI Surfacing

- [ ] Ensure updated docs are visible and accessible in the Ora UI ("System Docs"/"Project Log" tab).
- [ ] No loop or feature may be considered "done" until the relevant doc is updated and UI-surfaced.

### 6. Review & Confirm

- [ ] Review all changes for accuracy and completeness.
- [ ] Confirm nothing has been actioned "off-ledger" or outside the canonical docs.

## Guidance

- Never perform a system mutation, migration, or architectural pivot without updating the canonical docs.
- The Ora assistant should prompt for doc updates at every significant decision point.
- "If it's not in `/runtime/docs/`, it's not part of the system."
