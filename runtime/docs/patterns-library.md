# Ora's Pattern Library

*Ora updates this document as patterns emerge from successful workstreams*

## How Patterns Are Recorded

When Ora observes repeated success patterns across workstreams, they are documented here with:
- Context: When this pattern applies
- Pattern: What successful teams do
- Evidence: Measured impact
- Frequency: How often observed

## Active Patterns

### [Patterns will be added by Ora as they emerge]

Example format:
```
### Pattern: [Name]
- **Observed**: X times
- **Context**: [When this applies]
- **Pattern**: [What works]
- **Evidence**: [Measured results]
- **Last seen**: [Date]
```

## Pattern Categories
- Creation Patterns: What makes workstream creation successful
- Cadence Patterns: Rhythms that work for different teams  
- Evolution Patterns: How successful workstreams adapt
- Communication Patterns: How teams stay aligned
