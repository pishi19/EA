# Workstream Constitution Guide

## What Every Workstream Needs

### 1. Vision (Required)
A clear, measurable future state. Not "be successful" but "achieve X metric by Y date"

**Good Examples:**
- Sales: "Achieve 150% of quota with 90% team satisfaction by Q4"
- Engineering: "Ship features 50% faster with <2% defect rate"
- Customer Success: "95% retention with NPS >50"

### 2. Mission (Required)
Concrete daily activities that achieve the vision.

**Good Examples:**
- Sales: "Daily pipeline reviews, weekly coaching, systematic follow-ups"
- Engineering: "Continuous deployment, automated testing, code reviews"
- Customer Success: "Proactive check-ins, quarterly reviews, issue tracking"

### 3. Cadence (Required)
The rhythm of work - when things happen.

**Examples:**
- Daily: Standups, pipeline reviews
- Weekly: 1:1s, team syncs, metrics review
- Monthly: Retrospectives, OKR check-ins
- Quarterly: Planning, strategy review

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Vague vision without metrics
- Mission that's just a job description
- No clear cadence = drift
- Too many priorities = no priorities

## Questions Ora Should Ask
1. "How will you measure success?" (forces specific vision)
2. "What will your team do every day?" (clarifies mission)
3. "How often will you check progress?" (establishes cadence)
