### Phase 15: Data Flow Integrity, Policy & Systems Safeguards

#### LLM Prompt Context
**Strategic Focus**: Ensure long-term data reliability, agentic safety, and systems integrity across all workstreams and future workflows.

**Key Objectives**: 
- Codify and enforce data flow integrity policies and audit practices as first-class, scheduled roadmap items
- Systematically document all data flows for key workflows (load, mutate, chat, audit) with diagrams/tables and responsible owners
- Enforce explicit workstream context in all UI, API, agentic, and batch operations
- Log every mutation/agentic action and schedule regular schema/audit checks for orphans and staleness
- Require LLM prompt consistency, explicit batch operation protocol, and versioned snapshots
- Formalize conflict/error handling and agentic onboarding/training as required ongoing practices

**Success Criteria**: 
- All workflows, features, and new code slices reference and comply with these integrity safeguards
- Audit cycles and versioned snapshots are visible in the UI/logs
- LLM and agentic features cannot be released without data integrity gating
- New contributors and agents are trained to this phase as part of onboarding

### Reference: Data Flow Integrity Recommendations (2025-12-21 Deep Dive)

The following recommendations are to be implemented, scheduled, or referenced for all current and future Ora workflows and system extensions:

1. **Document All Data Flows**
   - For every workflow (load, mutate, chat, audit), create and maintain explicit diagrams/tables mapping data sources, triggers, and synchronization points.

2. **Enforce Explicit Workstream Context**
   - All UI, API, and agentic actions must require and log the `workstream` parameter‚Äînever assume "Ora" or any default.

3. **Log Every Mutation and Agentic Action**
   - All changes (manual or agentic) must be recorded in the artefact's execution log and, if critical, in the roadmap.md execution log.

4. **Audit for Orphans and Stale Data**
   - Schedule regular orphan detection and schema audits across all workstreams. Surface audit results in the admin UI.

5. **LLM Prompt Consistency**
   - All LLM/agentic prompts must include full artefact, program, workstream, and roadmap context‚Äînever partial views.

6. **Batch Operations Protocol**
   - Re-validate context and refresh UI/data state after every batch mutation. Confirm batch logs and rollback capabilities.

7. **Conflict and Error Handling**
   - Define and implement last-write-wins, optimistic rollback, and audit trail resolution for all concurrent mutations.

8. **Versioned Snapshots**
   - Regularly snapshot artefact, roadmap, and config files for disaster recovery and rollback.

9. **Agentic Training**
   - Onboard agents with data flow diagrams, audit logs, and roadmap.md as the canonical system-of-record.

> These recommendations are considered ongoing system policies and must be referenced or revisited after every system audit, architecture refactor, or onboarding of a new agentic capability.
