## Current Focus

- **Next Task:** 11.3.4 Roadmap-Driven Filtering Refactor (Already Complete) / 11.3.5 Hierarchical Label Rendering
- **Project:** 11.3 Interactive Roadmap Tree Navigation
- **Phase:** 11 â€“ Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering
- **Status:** in progress
- **Owner:** Ash
- **Priority:** High
- **Notes:** Task 11.3.3 Node-based Mutation/Consultation successfully completed. Enhanced TreeNavigation now features direct artefact mutations from tree nodes with hover-activated controls, comprehensive ContextPane with AI consultation and smart suggestions, real-time optimistic updates, and complete audit trails. Users can now perform status changes, tagging, edit, and delete operations directly from any tree node, plus get context-aware AI recommendations. Full integration with existing mutation infrastructure and memory trace system. Next focus is completing any remaining Project 11.3 tasks or moving to Phase 12.

## Ora's Constitutional OKRs - Q1 2025

### Objective 1: Establish Ora as an effective workstream creation partner
- KR1: Achieve 90% workstream creation completion rate (9 of 10 started workstreams get valid constitutions)
- KR2: Reduce average creation time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes through learned patterns
- KR3: Generate 20+ reusable patterns from workstream creation conversations

### Objective 2: Prove constitutional enforcement drives workstream success
- KR1: 100% of workstreams have vision, mission, and cadence defined
- KR2: 80% of workstreams add OKRs within 2 weeks of creation
- KR3: Track 5 workstreams for 30 days - measure constitution compliance vs. activity level

### Weekly Tracking
[ ] Week 1: _/10 workstreams, avg time: __ min, patterns: _/20
[ ] Week 2: _/10 workstreams, avg time: __ min, patterns: _/20

# Ora Roadmap

## Current Major Phases

1. **Phase 11:** Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering (Contextual-Chat-Demo UI)
2. **Phase 12:** Administration & Workstream Structure Management
3. **Phase 13:** Data Audit and Logical Grouping
4. **Phase 14+:** Semantic Feature Enhancements (tags, chat, scoring, sources, etc.)
5. **Phase 15:** Data Flow Integrity, Policy & Systems Safeguards
6. **Phase 16:** CI/CD and Cloud Backend (DB Migration)

### Immediate Subphase: Local DB, Admin Integration & Testing

**Purpose:**  
Transition all admin and artefact management from YAML/markdown to a robust, testable local Postgres database (with Qdrant for vector/semantic features). Ensure all admin UI and tools operate against the DB and are fully tested.

**Key Actions:**
- **Spin Up Local DB Stack**
    - Deploy Postgres via Docker Compose for local development
    - Ensure Qdrant remains accessible for vector/semantic operations

- **Schema Definition & Migration**
    - Design DB schemas for artefacts (phases, projects, tasks, loops), prompts (Cursor/system), users, roles, permissions, and audit logs
    - Use an ORM (e.g., Prisma, Drizzle, or TypeORM) for schema management and migrations
    - Script and execute migration of all legacy YAML/markdown artefacts and users into DB tables, marking migrated files as archived

- **API & Admin UI Integration**
    - Update API endpoints to CRUD artefacts, prompts, users, and audit records directly in the DB (abstract file access)
    - Migrate admin UI to operate fully against DB-backed API endpoints
    - Enable full CRUD, filtering, bulk operations, and audit log review in the admin interface

- **Testing & Validation**
    - Write integration tests for all API endpoints (CRUD, permissions, edge cases)
    - Write UI tests to ensure all admin and artefact functions work with the DB backend
    - Seed local dev DB with representative data for rapid development and testing

- **Migration Policy**
    - Archive legacy YAML/markdown files post-migration (read-only for historical audit)
    - Establish Postgres as the canonical source of truth for all admin, artefact, and prompt data
    - Document migration scripts and rollback procedures for safe, repeatable transitions

**Deliverables:**
- Local Postgres DB (Dockerized), Qdrant running, schemas defined
- All admin UI and tools fully DB-backed, YAML deprecated for new admin/artefact work
- Legacy data migrated and archived; DB is canonical
- Full suite of integration and UI tests validating admin and artefact management
- Documented migration, rollback, and backup procedures

**Rationale:**
- Unifies all admin, artefact, prompt, and audit logic in a single, testable system
- Provides local/cloud parity for future deployment (Supabase-ready)
- Eliminates risk of file/DB drift and supports agentic, multi-user workflows
- Lays foundation for LLM integration, source ingestion, and future cloud scaling

**Next Step:**  
â†’ Complete this Immediate Subphase before further backfilling artefacts, source integration, or advanced admin features.

### Phase 14: Semantic/LLM Feature Enhancements

*No execution logs yet - planning phase*

### Phase 15: Data Flow Integrity, Policy & Systems Safeguards

#### Data Flow Integrity Implementation

**Prompt 2025-12-21 (Ash):**
- **Task**: cursor:ora:task:15-1-1-data-flow-integrity-safeguards
- **Purpose**: Review and document all critical workflows with explicit diagrams/tables mapping data sources, triggers, and syncs
- **Implementation**: Enforce explicit workstream context and logging, implement orphan/stale data audits, codify batch ops protocol
- **Intent**: Establish long-term, testable, and enforceable system integrity as recurring, test-gated system phase
- **Result**: Data flow integrity now a first-class roadmap phase, with all core policies explicit and tracked

**Prompt 2025-12-21 (Ash):**
- **Task**: cursor:ora:task:15-2-1-data-flow-integrity-implementation
- **Purpose**: Move data flow and integrity recommendations into active, actionable phase
- **Implementation**: Create/maintain explicit diagrams, enforce workstream context, log mutations, schedule audits
- **Intent**: Every feature and workflow must comply with these policies and be tracked for ongoing audit and integrity
- **Result**: Project 15.2 open for systematic implementation, with all future development gated on integrity protocol adherence

#### Data Flow Integrity Recommendations Reference

**Core Policies** (to be implemented/scheduled/referenced for all current and future Ora workflows):
1. Document All Data Flows: Explicit diagrams/tables mapping data sources, triggers, synchronization points
2. Enforce Explicit Workstream Context: All UI, API, agentic actions must require/log workstream parameter
3. Log Every Mutation and Agentic Action: Record all changes in artefact execution logs and roadmap.md
4. Audit for Orphans and Stale Data: Schedule regular orphan detection and schema audits, surface in admin UI
5. LLM Prompt Consistency: Include full artefact, program, workstream, roadmap context
6. Batch Operations Protocol: Re-validate context after every batch mutation
7. Conflict and Error Handling: Define/implement last-write-wins, optimistic rollback, audit trail resolution
8. Versioned Snapshots: Regular snapshots for disaster recovery and rollback
9. Agentic Training: Onboard agents with data flow diagrams, audit logs, roadmap.md as canonical system-of-record

### Phase 16: CI/CD and Cloud Backend (DB Migration)

*No execution logs yet - planning phase*

## Appendix: Global Tagging Registry & DB Schema Design

### Global Tags (System-derived)

| Tag         | Description                              | Example Use         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| urgent      | Requires immediate attention             | For all programs    |
| feedback    | Needs human review or feedback           | LLM-assigned        |
| ai-suggested| Proposed by agent/LLM                    | Semantic enrichment |
| customer    | Relates to customer-facing artefacts     | Service tasks       |
| compliance  | Relates to compliance/regulatory         | Audit artefacts     |
| bug         | A known issue, needs fixing              | Task/loop           |
| enhancement | Feature request or improvement           | Project planning    |

> This list will grow as system or LLMs enrich artefacts. Global tags are visible and filterable across the entire system.
