## Change Log

- [2025-12-13] Semantic Chat Classic Restoration completed - Restored previously lost "Semantic Chat Classic" page with embedded, expandable context-aware chat for each artefact. Features include individual expand/collapse chat controls, bulk expand/collapse functionality, contextual chat scoped to loop UUID and file path with persistent history, filtering preservation across chat states, and Memory Trace/Execution Log integration. Added to navigation alongside existing "Semantic Chat" without replacement. Created Collapsible UI component and established dual semantic chat interface pattern (linked to Phase 11 UI architecture enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] Comprehensive Artefact Filtering Implementation completed - Implemented full multi-dimensional artefact filtering in Semantic Chat Demo with workstream, program (phase), and project (tags) filtering capabilities. Enhanced with real-time filtering of 53+ artefacts, dynamic counts, comprehensive sorting options, and filter reset functionality following established UI patterns from SystemView/PhaseDocView (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] Semantic Chat Demo Elevation & Enhanced Filtering completed - Elevated Contextual Chat Demo to primary navigation as "Semantic Chat" with comprehensive artefact filtering (workstream, phase/program, tag/project, status) and real-time filter effects, establishing semantic chat as core architectural feature (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] Workstream Filtering UI Enhancement completed - Added workstream filtering dropdown to PhaseDocView component, achieving consistent workstream-based filtering across all loop views (SystemView and PhaseDocView) with proper API integration and responsive design (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] System Docs UI Integration completed - Added dedicated "System Docs" tab to Contextual Chat Demo UI, surfacing all `/runtime/docs/` files with read-only markdown rendering (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-06-08] Phase 11 hierarchical structure implemented - Established program/project/task hierarchy with explicit tracking and status management
- [2025-06-08] Roadmap doc seeded for canonical reference.

# Project Roadmap

- **Structural Issues**: 17 files missing required sections (Purpose, Objectives)
- **Orphaned Artefacts**: 8 files using non-canonical workstreams
- **Quality Score**: Only 20% of files fully compliant with schema requirements

### Future Opportunities
1. **Automated Remediation**: Extend audit to fix simple issues automatically
2. **UI Integration**: Display audit results in system dashboard for real-time monitoring
3. **Scheduled Audits**: Regular automated execution with alerting for quality degradation
4. **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis of data quality improvements over time
5. **Custom Validation**: User-configurable rules for domain-specific requirements

This capability provides essential infrastructure for maintaining high-quality metadata across the loop collection, supporting better system integrity and user experience through improved filtering and discovery.
