# Ora Roadmap

## Current Major Phases

1. **Phase 11:** Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering (Contextual-Chat-Demo UI)
2. **Phase 12:** Administration & Workstream Structure Management
3. **Phase 13:** Data Audit and Logical Grouping
4. **Phase 14+:** Semantic Feature Enhancements (tags, chat, scoring, sources, etc.)

## Status

- Phase 10.2: Complete
- Phase 11: In Planning

## Change Log

- [2025-12-13] Comprehensive Artefact Filtering Implementation completed - Implemented full multi-dimensional artefact filtering in Semantic Chat Demo with workstream, program (phase), and project (tags) filtering capabilities. Enhanced with real-time filtering of 53+ artefacts, dynamic counts, comprehensive sorting options, and filter reset functionality following established UI patterns from SystemView/PhaseDocView (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] Semantic Chat Demo Elevation & Enhanced Filtering completed - Elevated Contextual Chat Demo to primary navigation as "Semantic Chat" with comprehensive artefact filtering (workstream, phase/program, tag/project, status) and real-time filter effects, establishing semantic chat as core architectural feature (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] Workstream Filtering UI Enhancement completed - Added workstream filtering dropdown to PhaseDocView component, achieving consistent workstream-based filtering across all loop views (SystemView and PhaseDocView) with proper API integration and responsive design (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-12-13] System Docs UI Integration completed - Added dedicated "System Docs" tab to Contextual Chat Demo UI, surfacing all `/runtime/docs/` files with read-only markdown rendering (linked to Phase 11 UI enhancements)
- [2025-06-08] Roadmap doc seeded for canonical reference.

# Project Roadmap

## 2025-06-08: Loop Metadata Audit System

**Capability**: Data Quality Analysis & Audit Automation  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Impact**: High - Foundation for data integrity and system compliance  

### Implementation Summary
Delivered comprehensive loop metadata audit system with TypeScript-based automation that analyzes all 55 loop files for data quality issues.

### Key Achievements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Automated scanning of entire `/runtime/loops/` collection
- **Multi-dimensional Validation**: Metadata fields, required sections, canonical values
- **Detailed Reporting**: Statistics, distributions, file-by-file analysis with actionable recommendations
- **Orphan Detection**: Identification of artefacts not assigned to canonical workstreams
- **Performance**: ~2 second execution for full collection analysis

### Technical Deliverables
1. **Audit Script**: `scripts/audit-loop-metadata.ts` with modular TypeScript architecture
2. **Validation Engine**: Rules for required fields, sections, and canonical value compliance
3. **Report Generator**: Comprehensive markdown report with statistics and recommendations
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful parsing failures with detailed error reporting

### Business Value
- **Data Quality Visibility**: 80% of files identified with metadata issues requiring attention
- **Compliance Support**: Enables adherence to Ora Alignment Protocol requirements
- **Improved Discoverability**: Better filtering and search capabilities through consistent metadata
- **Maintenance Automation**: Repeatable process for ongoing data quality monitoring

### Critical Findings
- **Field Completeness**: uuid (91%), title (93%), phase (84%), workstream (85%)
- **Structural Issues**: 17 files missing required sections (Purpose, Objectives)
- **Orphaned Artefacts**: 8 files using non-canonical workstreams
- **Quality Score**: Only 20% of files fully compliant with schema requirements

### Future Opportunities
1. **Automated Remediation**: Extend audit to fix simple issues automatically
2. **UI Integration**: Display audit results in system dashboard for real-time monitoring
3. **Scheduled Audits**: Regular automated execution with alerting for quality degradation
4. **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis of data quality improvements over time
5. **Custom Validation**: User-configurable rules for domain-specific requirements

This capability provides essential infrastructure for maintaining high-quality metadata across the loop collection, supporting better system integrity and user experience through improved filtering and discovery.
