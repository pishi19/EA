## Current Focus

- **Next Task:** 11.3.2 In-situ Chat & Memory Trace in Tree
- **Project:** 11.3 Interactive Roadmap Tree Navigation
- **Phase:** 11 ‚Äì Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering
- **Status:** in progress
- **Owner:** Ash
- **Priority:** High
- **Notes:** Task 11.3.4 Roadmap-Driven Filtering Refactor successfully completed.

- **Integration Value**: 7 high-value fields identified for external source mapping
- **Evolution Patterns**: 17 fields need standardization, 5 core sections well-established

## 2025-06-08: Loop Metadata Audit System

**Capability**: Data Quality Analysis & Audit Automation  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Impact**: High - Foundation for data integrity and system compliance  

### Implementation Summary
Delivered comprehensive loop metadata audit system with TypeScript-based automation that analyzes all 55 loop files for data quality issues.

### Key Achievements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Automated scanning of entire `/runtime/loops/` collection
- **Multi-dimensional Validation**: Metadata fields, required sections, canonical values
- **Detailed Reporting**: Statistics, distributions, file-by-file analysis with actionable recommendations
- **Orphan Detection**: Identification of artefacts not assigned to canonical workstreams
- **Performance**: ~2 second execution for full collection analysis

### Technical Deliverables
1. **Audit Script**: `scripts/audit-loop-metadata.ts` with modular TypeScript architecture
2. **Validation Engine**: Rules for required fields, sections, and canonical value compliance
3. **Report Generator**: Comprehensive markdown report with statistics and recommendations
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful parsing failures with detailed error reporting

### Business Value
- **Data Quality Visibility**: 80% of files identified with metadata issues requiring attention
- **Compliance Support**: Enables adherence to Ora Alignment Protocol requirements
- **Improved Discoverability**: Better filtering and search capabilities through consistent metadata
- **Maintenance Automation**: Repeatable process for ongoing data quality monitoring

### Critical Findings
- **Field Completeness**: uuid (91%), title (93%), phase (84%), workstream (85%)
- **Structural Issues**: 17 files missing required sections (Purpose, Objectives)
- **Orphaned Artefacts**: 8 files using non-canonical workstreams
- **Quality Score**: Only 20% of files fully compliant with schema requirements

### Future Opportunities
1. **Automated Remediation**: Extend audit to fix simple issues automatically
2. **UI Integration**: Display audit results in system dashboard for real-time monitoring
3. **Scheduled Audits**: Regular automated execution with alerting for quality degradation
4. **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis of data quality improvements over time
5. **Custom Validation**: User-configurable rules for domain-specific requirements

This capability provides essential infrastructure for maintaining high-quality metadata across the loop collection, supporting better system integrity and user experience through improved filtering and discovery.
