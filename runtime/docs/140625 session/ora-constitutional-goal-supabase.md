# Ora Constitutional OKRs & Supabase Evolution

## Ora's Constitutional OKRs

### Q1 2025 OKRs (Local Mastery Phase)

**Objective 1: Establish Ora as an effective workstream creation partner**
- **KR1**: Achieve 90% workstream creation completion rate (9 of 10 started workstreams get valid constitutions)
- **KR2**: Reduce average creation time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes through learned patterns
- **KR3**: Generate 20+ reusable patterns from workstream creation conversations

**Objective 2: Prove constitutional enforcement drives workstream success**
- **KR1**: 100% of workstreams have vision, mission, and cadence defined
- **KR2**: 80% of workstreams add OKRs within 2 weeks of creation
- **KR3**: Track 5 workstreams for 30 days - measure constitution compliance vs. activity level

**Objective 3: Build foundation for multi-user platform evolution**
- **KR1**: Database schema remains stable (no breaking changes) for 14+ consecutive days
- **KR2**: Create automated test suite with 80% coverage for core flows
- **KR3**: Document 10 real workstream creation case studies with patterns

### Q2 2025 OKRs (Cloud Readiness Phase)

**Objective 1: Validate Ora's readiness for team-wide deployment**
- **KR1**: Support 3 concurrent users creating workstreams without conflicts
- **KR2**: Achieve <2 second response time for all operations at 10x current load
- **KR3**: Complete security audit with zero critical vulnerabilities

**Objective 2: Prepare seamless Supabase migration**
- **KR1**: Create migration scripts that preserve 100% of workstream data
- **KR2**: Run parallel systems for 7 days with zero data inconsistencies
- **KR3**: Complete Supabase feature parity checklist (auth, RLS, real-time)

**Objective 3: Demonstrate collaborative value**
- **KR1**: Identify 5 specific use cases where cloud deployment adds measurable value
- **KR2**: Get 3 team members requesting cloud access for collaboration
- **KR3**: Design and test real-time workstream collaboration features

### Success Metrics Evolution

**Phase Transition Triggers:**
- **To Cloud Readiness**: Q1 OKR achievement >80%
- **To Supabase Migration**: Q2 OKR achievement >80% + active user demand
- **To Production**: Zero critical bugs for 14 days post-migration

### Weekly KR Tracking

```markdown
## Week of [Date]
- KR1.1: [X]/10 workstreams completed (target: 9)
- KR1.2: Average time: [X] min (target: <10)
- KR1.3: Patterns collected: [X]/20
- Notes: [Observations about progress]
