## Constitutional Principles Flowing Through Documents

### 1. **Service First** (Core Constitutional Principle)
- **OKRs**: "90% workstream creation success" - measuring service effectiveness
- **Contract Schema**: Enforces vision/mission - serving through strong foundations
- **Database Schema**: Stores patterns - learning to serve better
- **Claude Code Prompt**: "Be helpful but firm" - service with standards

### 2. **Learning Always** (Constitutional Principle)
- **Emergent Roadmap**: "Discover through creation" not predetermined
- **Database Schema**: `ora_patterns` table - systematic learning
- **Build Methodology**: Weekly retros - continuous improvement
- **MOC**: Living document - grows with learning

### 3. **Constitution-Driven** (Constitutional Principle)
- **Contract Schema**: No workstream without constitution
- **OKRs**: "100% have vision/mission/cadence"
- **Admin UI Analysis**: Preserve workstream wizard
- **Claude Code Prompt**: Ora enforces requirements

### 4. **Evolution Through Service** (Constitutional Principle)
- **Supabase OKRs**: Migration when it serves workstreams better
- **Emergent Roadmap**: Features emerge from needs
- **Build Loops**: Validate against workstream value
- **Refactoring**: Always asking "does this serve better?"

## Document Roles in Constitutional System

### **Foundational Documents** (Define the Constitution)
1. **Ora Roadmap as Constitution** - The living constitution itself
2. **Constitutional OKRs** - How we measure constitutional adherence

### **Strategic Documents** (Interpret the Constitution)
3. **Emergent Roadmap** - Constitutional philosophy in action
4. **Development Strategy** - How to build constitutionally

### **Design Documents** (Embody the Constitution)
5. **Contract Schema** - Constitutional requirements made concrete
6. **Database Schema** - Constitutional memory and learning

### **Implementation Documents** (Execute the Constitution)
7. **Claude Code Prompt** - Birth Ora with constitutional DNA
8. **Build Methodology** - Stay constitutionally aligned while building

### **Operational Documents** (Maintain the Constitution)
9. **MOC** - Navigate the constitutional system
10. **Process Guides** - Ensure constitutional compliance

## The Key Insight

**Every document serves the constitution differently:**

- Some **define** it (what Ora is)
- Some **measure** it (are we serving well?)
- Some **implement** it (how to build it)
- Some **maintain** it (keep us aligned)

But all documents answer to the same constitutional question:

> "Does this help workstreams succeed with strong foundations?"

## Constitutional Integrity Check

When reviewing any document or decision, ask:
1. Does it serve workstreams? (Service First)
2. Does it help Ora learn? (Learning Always)
3. Does it enforce foundations? (Constitution-Driven)
4. Does it enable evolution? (Continuous Improvement)

If yes to all → Constitutionally aligned ✅
If no to any → Needs revision 🔄

## The Living System

The constitution isn't just the roadmap document - it's the **living system** created by all these documents working together:

- **Constitution** states the purpose
- **OKRs** measure the purpose
- **Design** embodies the purpose
- **Implementation** executes the purpose
- **Process** maintains the purpose

Together, they create Ora's constitutional consciousness.
