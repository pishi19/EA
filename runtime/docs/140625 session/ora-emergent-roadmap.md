# Ora Emergent Roadmap - From Creation Forward

## The Core Insight

**Stop building features. Start birthing workstreams.**

Everything emerges from the act of creation. The database schema, the agent behavior, the source integrations - all emerge from understanding what workstreams actually need when they're born.

---

## Phase 1: The Genesis - Workstream Creation

**Purpose**: Learn what workstreams need by creating them properly

### Discovery Loops

**Loop 1.1: First Conversation**
- Build minimal Admin Agent conversation
- Try to create a workstream
- Discover what data needs storing
- Let schema emerge from needs

**Loop 1.2: Constitution Emergence**
- What makes a workstream "ready"?
- What won't the agent let you skip?
- How does constitution evolve?
- Database tables emerge from this

**Loop 1.3: Real Workstream Birth**
- Create an actual workstream (Customer Success? Sales?)
- Document every decision point
- Note every pattern
- Schema solidifies from reality

### What Emerges
- Database schema (from what we need to store)
- Agent personality (from helpful conversations)
- Validation rules (from what matters)
- Patterns (from what works)

---

## Phase 2: Serving What Was Born

**Purpose**: Now that workstreams exist, serve their needs

### Discovery Loops

**Loop 2.1: The Workstream Asks**
- What does this workstream need to see?
- What cadence did it request?
- What sources should feed it?
- UI needs emerge from workstream needs

**Loop 2.2: First Loops**
- Workstream needs information flows
- Create loops based on constitution
- Learn routing patterns
- Integration needs emerge

**Loop 2.3: Pattern Recognition**
- Multiple workstreams reveal patterns
- Common needs become features
- Unique needs stay custom
- Platform capabilities emerge

---

## Phase N: Continuous Evolution

Each new workstream teaches Ora:
- New patterns
- New source needs  
- New cadences
- New success metrics

The roadmap is never "done" - it evolves as Ora serves.

---

## What This Changes

### Old Way (Predetermined Phases)
"Build filtering" → "Build admin" → "Build sources" → Hope it works

### New Way (Emergent Development)
Create workstream → Discover needs → Build what's needed → Learn → Repeat

### The UI Pages
- Don't drive development
- Become windows into workstreams
- Evolve based on workstream needs
- Multi-tenant naturally (workstreams exist)

---

## Success Metrics

Not:
- ✓ Built Phase 11
- ✓ Built Phase 12
- ✓ Built Phase 13

But:
- ✓ First workstream has constitution
- ✓ Workstream gets value from loops
- ✓ Patterns recognized across workstreams
- ✓ Ora evolves based on needs

---

## The Methodology Remains

```
Define → Build → Validate → Reflect → Next
```

But now:
- **Define** = What does workstream creation need?
- **Build** = Minimum to enable that
- **Validate** = Can we create a real workstream?
- **Reflect** = What patterns emerged?
- **Next** = What does the workstream need now?

---

## Starting Point

**Tomorrow's Work**:
Not "Build Phase 11.5 database schema"
But "Have first Admin Agent conversation about creating a workstream"

The schema will tell us what it needs to be.
