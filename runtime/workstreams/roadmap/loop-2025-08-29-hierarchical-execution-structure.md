summary: |
  This loop defines the structural execution hierarchy for Ora: workstreams contain programs, programs contain projects, and projects contain tasks. Each layer should support contextual reasoning and discussion, forming a foundation for scoped GPT interaction, memory traceability, and UI navigation.
---

## Purpose

To establish a semantic execution hierarchy that mirrors real-world reasoning and operational scopes. This model will allow Ora to bind tasks, feedback, reasoning, and memory to the appropriate layer of abstraction â€” ensuring clarity, traceability, and actionable insight.

## âœ… Execution Hierarchy

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Workstream | Thematic container (e.g. roadmap, hiring, ops, client program) |
| Program | Scoped initiative with a deliverable objective (e.g. UI refactor, GPT integration) |
| Project | Executable slice or phase of a program (e.g. Phase 10.1, Feature X Delivery) |
| Task | Discrete, actionable unit (checklist or atomic mutation) |

Each level must support:
- Persistent metadata and trace
- In-situ chat interface
- Linked reasoning and memory trace
- Loggable execution updates

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Define folder schema under `/runtime/workstreams/` to support nested hierarchy
- [ ] Establish `plan.md`, `chat.md`, `memory.md` per level
- [ ] Ensure all tasks include a `source:` field referencing the parent unit
- [ ] Refactor UI planning views to navigate or filter by this structure
- [ ] Design scoped GPT prompt scaffolds for each layer
