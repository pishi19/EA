## Current Focus

- **Next Task:** 11.3.4 Roadmap-Driven Filtering Refactor (Already Complete) / 11.3.5 Hierarchical Label Rendering
- **Project:** 11.3 Interactive Roadmap Tree Navigation
- **Phase:** 11 ‚Äì Artefact Hierarchy and Filtering
- **Status:** in progress
- **Owner:** Ash
- **Priority:** High
- **Notes:** Task 11.3.3 Node-based Mutation/Consultation successfully completed. Enhanced TreeNavigation now features direct artefact mutations from tree nodes with hover-activated controls, comprehensive ContextPane with AI consultation and smart suggestions, real-time optimistic updates, and complete audit trails. Users can now perform status changes, tagging, edit, and delete operations directly from any tree node, plus get context-aware AI recommendations.

## Expanded System Roadmap (Exploded Systems View)

### Phase 11: Artefact Hierarchy, Filtering & Chat

#### LLM Prompt Context
**Strategic Focus**: Establish unified artefact management foundation with semantic chat integration and intuitive navigation.

**Key Objectives**: 
- Canonicalize artefact schema for consistent data structure and taxonomy compliance
- Implement sophisticated filtering and mutation capabilities with optimistic UI patterns
- Enable contextual chat embedding throughout all artefact interactions
- Build interactive roadmap tree navigation for hierarchical data exploration

**Current Challenges**: 
- Legacy artefact files require schema alignment and metadata standardization
- Complex filtering dependencies across workstream/program/project/artefact hierarchy
- Performance optimization needed for real-time updates and batch operations

**Success Criteria**: 
- All artefacts follow canonical schema with complete taxonomy compliance
- Users can efficiently navigate, filter, and mutate artefacts with immediate feedback
- Contextual chat provides intelligent assistance within full artefact context
- Tree navigation enables intuitive exploration of entire system hierarchy

**Dependencies**: 
- Requires robust parsing infrastructure for roadmap.md as canonical source
- API layer must support optimistic updates with rollback capabilities
- Chat integration depends on reliable memory trace and context passing

**Next Phase Preparation**: Foundation for Phase 12 administration features and automated artefact lifecycle management.

  - Project 12.9: Multi-Workstream Architecture Transformation

#### Execution Prompts Log

- **Prompt 2025-12-20 (Ash):**
    ```
    # cursor:ora:task:12-x-multi-workstream-architecture
    1. Log audit findings in roadmap.md as canonical reference for multi-workstream refactor.
    2. Begin refactoring codebase to:
        - Support /workstream/{name}/ URLs and routing throughout all UI and API
        - Move to per-workstream roadmap.md files and artefact directories
        - Update all filtering, tree, and navigation logic to select/scope by workstream
        - Inject workstream context into all artefact, API, and LLM/chat operations
        - Update batch mutation, orphan detection, and permission logic for multi-tenant isolation
    3. Create new test cases and integration tests for at least two parallel workstreams (e.g., Ora and Mecca).
    4. Review and refactor all places "Ora" is hardcoded‚Äîreplace with dynamic workstream detection everywhere.
    5. Log all progress, blockers, and schema changes in roadmap.md for ongoing architectural trace.
    
    # Intent: Transform Ora from a single-tenant monolith into a scalable, multi-workstream, agentic platform for cross-domain operation.
    ```
    *Intent: Transform Ora from single-tenant monolith to scalable multi-workstream platform. Support /workstream/{name}/ routing, per-workstream roadmaps/artefacts, dynamic workstream detection replacing hardcoded "Ora", multi-tenant isolation, and comprehensive test coverage for parallel workstreams.*
    *Result: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Architecture audit completed, refactor initiated*

**Multi-Workstream Architecture Audit Findings (2025-12-20)**:

1. **Hardcoded "Ora" References Found**:
   - **UI Components**: 47+ instances in workstream-filter-demo, TaskBoard, filtering logic
   - **API Routes**: demo-loops, plan-tasks, roadmap parsing - all default to "Ora"
   - **Constants**: CANONICAL_WORKSTREAMS, CANONICAL_PROGRAMS hardcoded structure
   - **Parser Logic**: roadmapParser.ts assumes single roadmap.md, returns ['Ora'] workstreams
   - **Plan Parser**: "Ora-Suggested Tasks" hardcoded in plan parsing and task sections
   - **Test Files**: Mock data and test cases all reference "Ora" workstream

2. **Single-Tenant Architecture Issues**:
   - **Directory Structure**: Single `runtime/loops/` for all artefacts
   - **Roadmap Management**: Single `runtime/docs/roadmap.md` file
   - **URL Structure**: No workstream routing (`/workstream/{name}/` needed)
   - **API Endpoints**: No workstream context in request/response handling
   - **Database Schema**: No workstream isolation in data loading
   - **Memory/Chat**: No workstream scoping in LLM context

3. **Required Refactor Scope**:
   - **Frontend**: 15+ components need workstream awareness
   - **Backend**: 20+ API routes need workstream routing/context
   - **Data Layer**: Directory restructure to `/runtime/workstreams/{name}/`
   - **Navigation**: URL structure change to `/workstream/{name}/[page]`
   - **Testing**: New test cases for multi-workstream scenarios
   - **Constants**: Dynamic workstream detection system

      - Task 12.9.1: Multi-Workstream URL Routing and Navigation
          - Description: Implement /workstream/{name}/ URL structure throughout frontend and API routing. Update all navigation, breadcrumbs, and deep linking to include workstream context. Ensure all pages and API endpoints are workstream-aware.
      - Task 12.9.2: Per-Workstream Data Directory Structure
          - Description: Refactor runtime directory to support `/runtime/workstreams/{name}/` structure with per-workstream roadmaps, artefacts, and configuration. Implement migration logic for existing "Ora" data.
      - Task 12.9.3: Dynamic Workstream Detection and Context Injection
          - Description: Replace all hardcoded "Ora" references with dynamic workstream detection. Update filtering, parsing, and API logic to inject workstream context everywhere. Build workstream registry and management system.
      - Task 12.9.4: Multi-Workstream API Layer and Authentication
          - Description: Implement workstream-scoped API routing, authentication, and permission isolation. Ensure all mutations, queries, and LLM operations are properly scoped to workstream context with multi-tenant isolation.
      - Task 12.9.5: Multi-Workstream Testing and Validation
          - Description: Create comprehensive test suite for parallel workstreams (Ora, Mecca, Sales, etc.). Implement integration tests, data isolation validation, and workstream-specific scenarios with complete test coverage.
