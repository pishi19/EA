## âœ… Objectives

Create reusable UI components for add, edit, and delete task operations within the filtered roadmap/task view. These components should provide seamless inline editing capabilities while maintaining the existing filter state and UI consistency.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- Create InlineTaskEditor component with add/edit/delete modes
- Design TaskMutationControls for action buttons (add, edit, delete, save, cancel)
- Implement inline form validation for task fields (title, status, tags, etc.)
- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick mutations (Ctrl+N for new, Ctrl+E for edit, Delete for remove)
- Ensure UI controls integrate seamlessly with existing filter components
- Add loading states and error handling for mutation operations
- Create confirmation modals for destructive actions (delete tasks)

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-12-14: Task created as first implementation step for Phase 11.2.2 inline mutation functionality.
- 2025-12-14: âœ… COMPLETE - Implemented comprehensive inline task mutation system:
  - Created InlineTaskEditor component with add/edit/delete modes and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Enter, Escape)
  - Built TaskMutationControls with inline, overlay, and sidebar variants
  - Implemented /api/task-mutations endpoint with full CRUD operations
  - Integrated mutation controls into workstream-filter-demo with real-time updates
  - Added form validation, error handling, loading states, and confirmation dialogs
  - Tested API functionality with successful task creation and visibility in filtered views
- 2025-12-14: Canonical taxonomy and roadmap structure committed and tagged at taxonomy-2025-12-14-canonical-structure. Model: workstream ("Ora") â†’ program (phase) â†’ project (grouping) â†’ artefact (task/note/thought). All artefacts versioned and discoverable only within roadmap tree. UI filtering aligned.

## ðŸ§  Memory Trace

- Parent task: Phase 11.2.2 â€“ Implement Inline Task Mutation in Filtered View (44DAF6DD-253D-4AA0-A9C8-B76BAA58F9CD)
- Building on existing filtering infrastructure from Phase 11.2.1
- UI components should follow shadcn/ui patterns established in workstream-filter-demo
- Need to maintain filter state during mutation operations
