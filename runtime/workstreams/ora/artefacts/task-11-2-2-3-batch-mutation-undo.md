## âœ… Objectives

Implement batch mutation support (multi-select add/edit/delete) and undo/redo functionality for artefacts within filtered project views, using optimistic UI patterns. All batch mutations must be reversible, logged, and taxonomy-aligned.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- Add multi-select controls for batch mutation
- Support batch add, edit, and delete actions (optimistic updates)
- Implement global undo/redo stack with rollback for all actions
- Ensure all mutations are taxonomy-aware and update roadmap+artefacts
- Log batch and undo/redo actions in execution log
- Update manifest and system docs after completion

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-12-14: Artefact scaffolded and roadmap updated for batch mutation/undo.
- 2025-12-14: Batch mutation API endpoint implemented (/api/task-mutations/batch)
- 2025-12-14: Undo/redo system hook created (use-undo-redo.ts)
- 2025-12-14: Batch UI controls component implemented (BatchTaskControls, SelectableTaskCard)
- 2025-12-14: Integration completed with workstream-filter-demo
- 2025-12-14: Comprehensive testing implemented (14 test cases)
- 2025-12-14: Documentation and summary completed
- 2025-12-14: âœ… Task completed successfully - All objectives achieved

## ðŸ§  Memory Trace

- Optimistic UI, atomic mutation, and canonical taxonomy in place
- This task extends mutation safety and power-user workflow
