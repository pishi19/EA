## âœ… Objectives

Implement comprehensive hierarchical filtering UI and API enforcement for the full canonical taxonomy model (workstream â†’ program â†’ project â†’ artefact). All filtering controls must respect schema alignment and roadmap structure, ensuring no orphaned or non-compliant artefacts are displayed.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- [x] Update filtering UI to support full taxonomy hierarchy
- [x] Add artefact type filtering (task, note, thought, execution, loop)
- [x] Implement hierarchical filter dependencies and cascading
- [x] Update API/query logic to enforce taxonomy compliance
- [x] Add real-time filtering with taxonomy validation
- [x] Create comprehensive test coverage for all filter combinations
- [x] Update documentation and execution logs
- [x] Validate edge cases (empty, partial, orphaned artefacts)
