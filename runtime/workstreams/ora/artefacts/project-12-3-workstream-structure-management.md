## ‚úÖ Objectives

Implement comprehensive workstream CRUD and configuration management with multi-tenant architecture support.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Workstream creation, editing, and deletion interface
- Configuration management for workstream settings
- Multi-tenant data isolation and validation
- Workstream template system for rapid setup
- Migration and import/export functionality

## üî¢ Tasks

- [x] Task 12.3.1: Workstream CRUD and configuration - **PARTIAL** (registry exists, UI missing)
- [x] Task 12.3.2: Workstream creation wizard - **COMPLETED** (full wizard UI implemented)
- [ ] Task 12.3.3: Configuration management interface - **MISSING**
- [ ] Task 12.3.4: Template system for new workstreams - **MISSING**
- [ ] Task 12.3.5: Import/export functionality - **MISSING**

## üßæ Execution Log

**2025-06-11: Project Audit Findings**
- **Current State**: Multi-workstream architecture implemented, UI management missing
- **What Works**: Workstream registry, context switching, data isolation, API infrastructure
- **Missing**: CRUD UI for workstreams, configuration management, template system
- **Status**: Upgraded from 'planning' to 'in_progress' based on infrastructure completion

**Existing Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Workstream Registry (`lib/workstream-api.ts`)
  - Complete `WORKSTREAM_REGISTRY` with ora, mecca, sales configurations
  - Workstream validation with `isValidWorkstream()`
  - Context extraction from URL, query, body, header
  - Permission and operation management per workstream
- ‚úÖ Workstream Context System (`lib/workstream-context.tsx`)
  - React context provider for workstream state management
  - URL-based workstream detection and navigation
  - Workstream validation and error handling
  - Dynamic workstream switching with proper routing
- ‚úÖ Multi-Workstream API Infrastructure
  - Complete data isolation per workstream
  - Workstream-scoped file operations (read, write, list)
  - Path utilities for workstream data directories
  - Audit logging per workstream
- ‚úÖ Data Directory Structure
  - Isolated workstream directories: `/runtime/workstreams/{name}/`
  - Separate artefacts, logs, and configuration per workstream
  - Ora, Mecca, and Sales workstreams with sample data

**Missing Implementation:**
- ‚ùå Workstream creation/editing UI
- ‚ùå Configuration management interface
- ‚ùå Workstream deletion with data migration
- ‚ùå Template system for rapid workstream setup
- ‚ùå Import/export functionality for workstream data
- ‚ùå Workstream health monitoring and analytics

## üß† Memory Trace

- **Context**: Multi-tenant workstream architecture management
- **Program**: Phase 12 ‚Äì Administration & Governance
- **Workstream**: Ora
- **Current Score**: 80% (architecture complete, management UI missing)
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Workstream API and registry system
  - Multi-workstream context provider
  - Data isolation infrastructure
  - Admin UI framework

## üåê System Context

**Project Overview**: Complete workstream lifecycle management
This project provides the management interface for creating, configuring, and maintaining workstreams within the multi-tenant Ora architecture.

**Dependencies**:
- Multi-workstream API infrastructure (completed)
- Workstream context system (completed)
- Data isolation architecture (completed)
- Admin UI framework (from Project 12.1)

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete workstream CRUD operations via UI
- Configuration management for all workstream settings
- Template-based workstream creation for rapid setup
- Data migration and import/export capabilities
- Health monitoring and analytics for all workstreams

**Current Implementation Details**:

**Workstream Registry:**
```typescript
interface WorkstreamConfig {
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'active' | 'planning' | 'archived';
  dataPath: string;
  allowedOperations: string[];
  owner?: string;
  phase?: string;
}
```

**Multi-Workstream Support:**
- ‚úÖ Ora: Active development workstream (full operations)
- ‚úÖ Mecca: Business development workstream (limited operations)
- ‚úÖ Sales: Marketing workstream (limited operations)

**API Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Workstream-scoped operations
getWorkstreamDataPath(workstream, ...segments)
readWorkstreamFile(workstream, ...pathSegments)
writeWorkstreamFile(workstream, content, ...pathSegments)
listWorkstreamFiles(workstream, ...pathSegments)
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Build workstream creation wizard UI
2. Implement configuration management interface
3. Create workstream templates for common setups
4. Add import/export functionality
5. Build workstream health monitoring dashboard

*Multi-workstream architecture is robust, need management UI for complete functionality*
