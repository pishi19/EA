# Ora Phase 7 ‚Äî Semantic Execution from Slice to Workstream

## üéØ Objective
Fully implement Ora's slice strategy by stabilizing the Gmail signal path, structuring loop metadata into a SQL-backed model, and surfacing task-based semantic cohesion across workstreams. Phase 7 formalizes the loop-to-roadmap pipeline with feedback-driven scoring and assistant-guided task orchestration.

This phase also operationalizes the core architectural principle:

> **Semantic cohesion across workstreams** ‚Äî Ora's ability to recognize, align, and orchestrate similar tasks across teams to improve organizational execution and cohesion.

---

## üì¶ Foundation from Phase 6
- ‚úÖ Chat UI supports semantic loop memory, feedback tagging, and roadmap promotion
- ‚úÖ Feedback scores stored in SQLite and surfaced in UI
- ‚úÖ Roadmap normalized to `runtime/roadmap/`
- ‚úÖ Slice framing defined (Gmail as proving ground)
- ‚úÖ Project rationale and strategy documents established
