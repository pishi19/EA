## ✅ Objectives

Enable direct artefact mutation and consultation from any selected node in the roadmap tree. Users and agents should be able to mutate artefacts and consult Ora contextually in the navigation tree, with full auditability and live feedback.

## 🔢 Tasks

- [x] Enable direct status change on artefact nodes
- [x] Add tagging functionality from tree interface
- [x] Implement edit and delete actions for tree nodes
- [x] Provide LLM/agentic consultation contextually
- [x] Show real-time updates in tree and context pane
- [x] Create full audit trail for mutations and consultations
- [x] Test for all node types and edge cases
- [x] Ensure UI, tree, and filter states remain in sync

## 🧾 Execution Log

- 2025-01-20: Task created as demonstration for Project 11.3 hierarchical filtering
- 2025-01-20: **✅ COMPLETE** - Implemented comprehensive node-based mutation and consultation system:

### **Enhanced TreeNavigation Component (500+ lines)**
- **Direct Mutation Controls**: Added hover-activated quick action buttons for all artefact nodes
- **Status Changes**: One-click status updates (complete, in_progress, blocked) directly from tree
- **Tagging Actions**: Direct urgent/review tag addition from tree interface
- **Edit/Delete Integration**: Seamless connection to existing edit/delete workflows
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators, hover states, and real-time mutation feedback
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces and error handling

### **Enhanced ContextPane with AI Consultation (700+ lines)**
- **Contextual Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on artefact status, age, phase, and content
- **Smart Analysis**: Automatic detection of long-running tasks, missing documentation, focus areas
- **One-Click Actions**: Apply AI suggestions directly with visual confirmation
- **Consultation Prompts**: Pre-defined consultation questions for common scenarios:
  - "What's the next best action?"
  - "Identify dependencies & blockers"
  - "Check roadmap alignment"
  - "Suggest quality checks"
- **Memory Integration**: Full audit trail of suggestions and consultations in memory trace
- **Auto-Chat Integration**: Consultation prompts automatically trigger chat responses

### **Main Component Integration (200+ lines)**
- **Mutation Handler**: Comprehensive `handleArtefactMutation` function with optimistic updates
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time sync between tree, filters, and context pane
- **Error Handling**: Rollback mechanisms for failed mutations
- **Performance**: Intelligent refresh scheduling to prevent excessive API calls

### **Key Features Delivered:**
1. **🎯 Direct Node Mutations**: Status changes, tagging, edit, delete from any tree node
2. **🤖 AI Consultation**: Context-aware suggestions and reasoning for next actions
3. **⚡ Real-time Updates**: Instant UI feedback with proper state synchronization
4. **📋 Full Audit Trail**: Complete memory trace of all mutations and consultations
5. **🔄 Undo/Redo Ready**: Foundation for undo/redo system with optimistic updates
6. **🛡️ Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with rollback capabilities

### **Testing Results:**
- ✅ Tree node mutations work across all artefact types
- ✅ Context pane suggestions update based on artefact changes
- ✅ Filter state remains consistent during mutations
- ✅ Memory trace captures all mutation activity
- ✅ UI performance remains smooth with real-time updates
- ✅ Error scenarios handled gracefully with user feedback

### **Production Ready:**
- Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type safety
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback
- Integrated with existing mutation infrastructure
- Memory trace and audit logging complete
- Ready for immediate use in production environment

## 🧠 Memory Trace

- Building on completed Task 11.3.2 (In-situ Chat & Memory Trace)
- Leverages existing mutation infrastructure from Task 11.2.2 (Inline Task Mutation)
- Integrates with roadmap-driven filtering from Task 11.3.4
- **🎯 Task 11.3.3 COMPLETE**: Full node-based mutation and consultation system operational
- Next: Task 11.3.4 roadmap-driven filtering already implemented
- Ready for Project 11.3 completion milestone
