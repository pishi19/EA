title: Project Refactor and Audit â€“ System Alignment for Long-Term Maintainability
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 1.0
tags: [refactor, audit, structure, boundary, system-alignment]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: stabilization
summary: |
  This loop initiates a comprehensive project audit and refactor to ensure Ora's structure, boundaries, and logic contracts are robust, testable, and semantically aligned. The audit spans UI, API, mutation, GPT scaffolding, filesystem layout, and data/logic separation to enforce long-term execution integrity.
---

## Purpose

To realign Ora's project structure and codebase after foundational architectural improvements. This audit ensures that logic boundaries, UI behavior, mutation safety, and data ownership are clear, consistent, and enforced across the system. It will resolve drift, clean up technical debt, and simplify future evolution.

## âœ… Audit and Refactor Scope

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Folder structure | Clear separation of runtime data, system code, UI components, and test logic |
| Mutation surface | All file writes routed through mutation-engine only |
| UI contracts | No direct file writes; render based on schema-validated data |
| GPT prompt layer | All scaffolded prompts respect file contracts and use mutation verbs |
| Error handling | Fallback UI for missing/malformed files, logged structured errors |
| Loop and phase consistency | All loops correctly linked to phase and tagged |
| Testing coverage | Ensure mutation, promotion, parser, and UI flows are covered |
| Planning vs execution | Distinction between `workstream_plan.md` and execution logic enforced |
