title: UI Execution Integration â€“ Finalizing the Interface Layer

summary: |
  This loop promotes Ora's Task Executor UI from a passive task viewer to an active semantic execution interface. It finalizes the binding between user interaction, loop file mutation, and system state verification. The UI becomes the declarative front end of Ora's execution contract.
---

## Purpose

To fully integrate Ora's UI into the system's reasoning and mutation flow, ensuring that all user actions reflect and mutate underlying loop files. This loop marks the transition where the UI no longer mimics execution â€” it *is* the execution interface.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Ensure all tasks shown in UI are loaded from loop markdown files
- [ ] Ensure all task completions update loop checklist + execution log
- [ ] Implement `Run` to record a reasoning trace into the loop file
- [ ] Show execution logs inline with task history in UI
- [ ] Track state mutations through loop UUIDs for full visibility

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Bind `Complete` to loop mutation (checklist + log)
- [ ] Bind `Run` to GPT reasoning + log append
- [ ] Parse and display `## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
- 2025-06-07: TaskExecutor now loads and mutates real loop files. Checklist state and execution logs are correctly reflected in the UI. However, test coverage for these behaviors remains incomplete. Tests were written but not stabilized. Mutation logic is operational and traceable. A follow-up loop will resolve remaining test instability.` entries in UI
- [ ] Persist changes and confirm in filesystem
- [ ] Add integration tests for each semantic component
- [ ] Mark Phase 8.4 initiated in phase tracker

## ðŸ”„ Execution Plan

1. Finalize mutation path from UI â†’ loop file
2. Link `Run` button to GPT call with task context
3. Write returned output into loop Execution Log
4. Render log below each task in UI
5. Confirm round-trip integrity
