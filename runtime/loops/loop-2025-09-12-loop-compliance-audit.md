title: Loop Compliance Audit â€“ Structural Validation Across All Runtime Loops
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.95
tags: [audit, schema, loop-integrity, validation, dry-run]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: reconciliation
summary: |
  This loop tracks the structural validation of all loop files in Ora's runtime system. It ensures each loop has the required semantic sections and frontmatter fields for reliable execution, UI display, and GPT reasoning. This audit uses dry-run mutation previews and schema validation to restore trust in the loop data layer.
---

## Purpose

To confirm that all loop files in /runtime/loops/ are compliant with Ora's semantic execution model. This includes verifying required markdown sections, proper frontmatter, and correct tagging by phase and workstream. The audit prepares for structural cleanup and GPT-safe operations without introducing drift.

---

## âœ… Validation Targets

Each `loop-*.md` file must contain:

**Required Sections**
- ## âœ… Objectives
- ## ðŸ”§ Tasks
- ## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
- ## ðŸ§  Memory Trace

**Required Frontmatter**
- uuid
- title
- phase
- workstream
- score
- status

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Load all files in /runtime/loops/
- [ ] Validate frontmatter fields
- [ ] Validate presence of required sections
- [ ] Generate dry-run patches for missing blocks
- [ ] Log all findings to /runtime/logs/loop-compliance-audit.json
- [ ] Report: how many complete, incomplete, and patch-ready
- [ ] Approve only safe, reviewed mutations

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [x] Scan all loop files in runtime directory
- [x] Validate structural compliance against schema
- [x] Generate comprehensive compliance report
- [x] Identify missing sections and frontmatter fields
- [x] Create patch suggestions for non-compliant files
- [x] Create dry-run audit script at `src/scripts/dry_run_audit_all_loops.ts`
- [x] Implement YAML frontmatter parsing and validation
- [x] Generate detailed JSON audit report with dry-run previews
- [ ] Execute approved structural fixes
- [ ] Validate post-patch compliance
- [ ] Update loop schema documentation

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Loop initiated to perform system-wide loop compliance validation using mutation engine dry-run functions.
- 2025-06-07T09:15:00.000Z: Created comprehensive dry-run audit script at `src/scripts/dry_run_audit_all_loops.ts` with:
  - YAML frontmatter parsing and validation
  - Markdown section structure validation
  - Dry-run mutation previews for missing sections
  - Detailed JSON audit report generation at `/runtime/logs/loop-compliance-audit.json`
  - Full compliance status reporting (49 files scanned, 0% compliance, specific gap analysis)
