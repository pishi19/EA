summary: >
  This loop scopes the UI integration of Ora as an embedded execution
  orchestrator. It defines how Ora becomes context-aware and present within
  every major interaction surface: loops, tasks, planning views, and phase
  dashboards. Ora will no longer be an external chat tool, but a semantic
  assistant embedded directly into the execution environment.
---

## Purpose

To embed Ora into the execution experience itself. Ora will track which phase, loop, or task is currently in focus and provide contextual guidance, actions, or reasoning inline. This establishes a coherent execution model where Ora is not external to action but *co-present*.

## ‚úÖ Embedding Targets

| Component | Orchestration Behavior |
|----------|------------------------|
| TaskCard | Ora suggests completion, promotion, or reflection |
| LoopDetail | Ora provides log prompts, memory trace insertion, or summary |
| PhaseCard | Ora summarizes phase health, loop gaps, task status |
| PlanningView | Ora proposes promotions, warns about disconnected items |
| ExecutorPage | Ora shows loop/task state, suggests closure or mutation |
| ChatPane | Scoped to loop/project/task, tied to context |
| SystemView | Persistent assistant bar: current phase/loop/task + GPT suggestion |
| Sidebar | Expandable control panel: GPT prompt, active loop, next actions |

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [ ] Add persistent ‚ÄúOra Context‚Äù bar showing active loop/phase/task
- [ ] Embed Ora in each LoopCard/TaskCard to suggest GPT-powered actions
- [ ] Integrate GPT reasoning scoped to loop.md, memory.md, chat.md
- [ ] Enable logging/log mutation through assistant dialog
- [ ] Highlight phase completion status and prompt phase transitions
- [ ] Visually distinguish Ora suggestions from human inputs
