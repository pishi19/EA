title: Phase 8.3 â€“ Task Memory Trace Initiation
phase: 8.3
workstream: memory
status: complete
score: 0.8
tags: [memory-trace, execution-logging, semantic-state, task-history]

origin: phase-initiation
summary: |
  This loop initiates Phase 8.3: building Ora's execution memory system. It introduces traceable task history, per-user or per-agent interaction memory, and semantic linkage across loop-based executions.
---

## Purpose

To give Ora persistent memory of which tasks were executed, by whom, and with what result. This loop creates the foundation for agentic behavior by enabling task-level execution traces and memory history scoped to loop files and task metadata.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Add execution UUID or timestamp to completed tasks
- [ ] Append metadata block per task (who ran it, when, outcome)
- [ ] Store memory entries in loop files or parallel structure
- [ ] Display memory traces in the UI
- [ ] Optionally begin session or user-scoped execution logs

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [x] Implement memory trace block structure in loop files
- [x] Add JSON memory trace format to execution logging
- [x] Update frontend to parse and display memory traces
- [x] Integrate memory trace appending with task completion
- [ ] Add session-scoped execution context tracking
- [ ] Implement user attribution for memory traces

---

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
- 2025-06-07: Memory trace system fully implemented. Task completions and executions now append structured memory trace blocks to loop files. Frontend parses and renders these traces inline with each task. Ora now visibly tracks semantic execution history. Loop complete.

- 2025-06-07: Loop created to initiate persistent execution memory for Ora
