title: Radix UI Compatibility with JSDOM ‚Äì Dropdown Testing Degraded
phase: 9.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: blocked
score: 0.5
tags: [testing, radix, jsdom, compatibility, dropdown, resilience]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: followup
summary: |
  This loop isolates a known failure in Jest test coverage for Ora's React Task Executor. The Radix UI dropdown (Select component via shadcn/ui) fails under JSDOM due to unimplemented browser methods. This blocks full test coverage until a structural workaround is implemented.
---

## Purpose

To isolate and document the specific Radix UI compatibility issues with JSDOM testing environment that prevent full test coverage of Ora's Task Executor UI components.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [ ] Document specific JSDOM/Radix UI incompatibilities
- [ ] Explore viable mocking strategies for missing DOM methods
- [ ] Evaluate alternative dropdown components for testing
- [ ] Propose long-term testing solution (mocks vs test runner change)
- [ ] Defer TaskExecutor filter coverage until resolution

## Context

The Radix UI dropdown used in Ora's Task Executor fails to function in Jest due to missing DOM methods like `hasPointerCapture` and `scrollIntoView`. These errors occur in JSDOM when rendering interactive components in portals or overlays.

## üîß Tasks

- [ ] Explore mocking `hasPointerCapture` and `scrollIntoView` via `Object.defineProperty`
- [ ] Spike Radix UI dropdown behavior in jsdom vs Playwright
- [ ] Evaluate whether to swap filter dropdown to non-Radix alternative
- [ ] Propose long-term solution: either advanced mocks or change test runner (e.g. Cypress or Playwright)
- [ ] Mark TaskExecutor filter coverage as deferred until resolved

## üîÅ Timeline

This loop is blocked until Phase 9. It is non-critical for user-facing behavior, but critical for full test validation and coverage metrics.
