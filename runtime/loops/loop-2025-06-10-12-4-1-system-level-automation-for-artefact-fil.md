## ‚úÖ Objectives

When a new task/project is created via UI or API, system automatically generates the artefact file in `/runtime/loops/` with canonical frontmatter, status, and taxonomy fields.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Implement system-level automation for artefact file creation
- Ensure full integration with existing mutation infrastructure
- Provide comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Test end-to-end functionality and error handling
- Document implementation and provide usage examples

## üî¢ Tasks

- [ ] Analyze requirements and existing system architecture
- [ ] Design implementation approach and integration points
- [ ] Implement core functionality with error handling
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for validation
- [ ] Update system documentation and user guides
- [ ] Conduct integration testing with existing workflows
- [ ] Deploy and validate in production environment

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-10: Task artefact scaffolded via automated batch creation system
- **2025-06-11: Audit Findings** - Task remains in planning status; not implemented
- Status: planning - Ready for development and implementation
- **Priority**: Deferred pending completion of Projects 12.1-12.3 admin UI components

## üß† Memory Trace

- **Context**: Part of Project 12.4 (Automated Artefact File Creation & Mutation Syncing)
- **Program**: Phase 12 ‚Äì Administration & Governance
- **Workstream**: Ora
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Roadmap.md synchronization system
  - Artefact file creation and management
  - Mutation tracking and audit infrastructure
  - UI/API integration for real-time updates

## üåê System Context

**Project Overview**: Automated Artefact File Creation & Mutation Syncing
This task is part of a comprehensive system to automate artefact lifecycle management, ensuring seamless synchronization between roadmap planning and actual implementation artifacts.

**Dependencies**:
- Canonical artefact schema (from Phase 11.1)
- Mutation infrastructure (from Phase 11.2)
- Roadmap parsing system (from Phase 11.3)

**Success Criteria**:
- Automated artefact creation on task/project creation
- Bidirectional sync between roadmap.md and artefact files
- Comprehensive orphan detection and remediation
- System integrity validation and recovery mechanisms
