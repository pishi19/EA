## âœ… Objectives

Implement comprehensive hierarchical filtering UI and API enforcement for the full canonical taxonomy model (workstream â†’ program â†’ project â†’ artefact). All filtering controls must respect schema alignment and roadmap structure, ensuring no orphaned or non-compliant artefacts are displayed.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- [x] Update filtering UI to support full taxonomy hierarchy
- [x] Add artefact type filtering (task, note, thought, execution, loop)
- [x] Implement hierarchical filter dependencies and cascading
- [x] Update API/query logic to enforce taxonomy compliance
- [x] Add real-time filtering with taxonomy validation
- [x] Create comprehensive test coverage for all filter combinations
- [x] Update documentation and execution logs
- [x] Validate edge cases (empty, partial, orphaned artefacts)

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-12-15: Task initiated for canonical taxonomy filtering enforcement
- 2025-12-15: Roadmap updated to set task as current focus
- 2025-12-15: Enhanced Artefact interface to include type field for taxonomy compliance
- 2025-12-15: Updated canonical taxonomy schema with "Ora" as default workstream
- 2025-12-15: Added comprehensive artefact type filtering (task, note, thought, execution, loop)
- 2025-12-15: Implemented hierarchical filter dependencies and cascading logic
- 2025-12-15: Enhanced filtering to enforce taxonomy compliance (orphaned items normalized)
- 2025-12-15: Updated UI with artefact type filter controls and enhanced layout
- 2025-12-15: Created comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases for taxonomy filtering
- 2025-12-15: Successfully validated filtering logic - only taxonomy-compliant artefacts shown
- 2025-12-15: ðŸŽ¯ Task 11.2.4.1 COMPLETE: Canonical taxonomy filtering enforcement implemented and validated

## ðŸ§  Memory Trace

- Building on Phase 11.2.2 inline mutation and batch operations
- Canonical taxonomy established: workstream â†’ program â†’ project â†’ artefact
- Default workstream: "Ora" with hierarchical filtering enforcement
- All artefacts must be taxonomy-compliant and roadmap-aligned
