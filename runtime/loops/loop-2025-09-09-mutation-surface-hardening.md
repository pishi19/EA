title: Mutation Surface Hardening ‚Äì Enforce All Structural Boundaries
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress

summary: |
  This loop reinforces Ora's entire mutation infrastructure to eliminate silent structural drift. It ensures all mutation logic (GPT, UI, API, file creation) passes through validated interfaces with known schemas and predictable results. This loop is the foundation of Ora's long-term semantic integrity.
---

## Purpose

To prevent any further regressions, file corruption, or UI-render failures by standardizing and validating all mutation pathways. This will ensure that GPT, UI components, and backend routes operate on predictable, append-safe instructions ‚Äî never full file replacements or unstructured rewrites.

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [ ] Refactor all GPT prompt scaffolds to use mutation engine verbs (`appendToSection`, `patchFrontmatter`, etc.)
- [ ] Disallow UI from sending full markdown bodies through API ‚Äî only deltas or semantic intent
- [x] Create `createLoopFile()` and `createTaskFile()` utilities with canonical section structure
- [x] Require `validateMarkdownSchema()` before all UI parsing and rendering
- [x] Add `appendToLog()` utility that enforces structured timestamp + actor format
- [x] Add fallback UI indicators for missing sections (`## üîß Tasks`, etc.)
- [ ] Remove all legacy or silent mutation paths (e.g., GPT full file rewrites)

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Mutation hardening loop initiated to lock down all execution surfaces and prevent systemic drift
- 2025-06-07: ‚úÖ Created `createLoopFile()` utility in `src/system/create-loop.ts` with comprehensive test validation - generates canonical loop markdown files with proper frontmatter and section structure
- 2025-06-07: ‚úÖ Extended mutation engine with three core functions: `appendToLog()` for structured execution logging, `validateMarkdownSchema()` for section validation with detailed error reporting, and `dryRunMutation()` for safe preview of file changes without disk writes - all functions tested and verified working correctly
- 2025-06-07: ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive UI schema validation across all major file loading points: Task Executor shows fallback UI blocks with warnings for invalid loop files, Phase Doc View displays inline error messages for structurally invalid loops with clear "No valid loops found" messaging, System View adds visual indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è) for incomplete loop files, and global validation API `/api/validate-schema` logs all schema violations to browser console with detailed file path and error information - all components now gracefully handle schema violations without breaking page rendering

## üîß Tasks

- [ ] Audit current mutation surface attack vectors
- [ ] Implement mutation input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add mutation authorization and access controls
- [ ] Create mutation rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Build mutation audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Establish mutation rollback and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test mutation security across all endpoints
