title: Phase 11.2.2 – Implement Inline Task Mutation in Filtered View

## ✅ Objectives

Implement add, edit, and delete actions for tasks inline within the filtered roadmap/task view UI. Ensure all mutations are routed through the API, updating both roadmap.md and the relevant loop file, with changes versioned and logged.

## 🔢 Tasks

- Scaffold UI controls for inline add/edit/delete within the filtered view
- Wire up API routes for all mutations
- Validate field updates in both artefact and roadmap file
- Log all mutations to execution log
- Add test cases for each mutation path

## 🧾 Execution Log

- 2025-12-14: Artefact scaffolded; roadmap updated.
- 2025-12-14: Status updated to in_progress; first implementation task created (Task 11.2.2.1 - Scaffold UI controls).
- 2025-12-14: Canonical taxonomy and roadmap structure committed and tagged at taxonomy-2025-12-14-canonical-structure. Model: workstream ("Ora") → program (phase) → project (grouping) → artefact (task/note/thought). All artefacts versioned and discoverable only within roadmap tree. UI filtering aligned.

## 🧠 Memory Trace

- Filtering and contextual chat already implemented (Phase 11.2.1)
- No orphan artefacts; all logic sequenced in vertical slice
