title: Task Promotion â€“ From Planning Board to Execution Context
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.9
tags: [task-promotion, planner, execution-bridge, semantic-transfer]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: planning-system
summary: |
  This loop defines the architecture for promoting tasks from the workstream planning board (`workstream_plan.md`) into executable contexts such as loop files (`loop-*.md`) or project task files (`task-*.md`). The goal is to establish a structured, traceable pathway from pre-execution intent to semantic execution context.
---

## Purpose

To create a clear contract between Ora's planning interface (task board) and its execution engine (task executor). Promotion enables tasks to transition from abstract intent to traceable, agentically executed actionsâ€”preserving authorship, context, and memory linkages.

---

## âœ… Promotion Model

| From | To |
|------|----|
| `workstream_plan.md` | `loop-*.md` or `task-*.md` under a project |
| `source:` | Updated to reflect new execution parent (loop, phase, project) |
| `status:` | Transitions from `pending` to `promoted` or `in_loop` |
| `log:` | Execution log updated in target file with timestamp and origin |
| `UI view:` | Task disappears from board or shows promoted badge; appears in executor |

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Define promotion handler from planning board to target file
- [x] Update task metadata (`source`, `status`)
- [x] Write task block into target execution file (loop or task)
- [x] Append log in destination file under `## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log`
- [x] Mark original in plan as `status: promoted`
- [x] Reflect promoted tasks in the Task Executor UI

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [x] Implement task promotion API endpoint (`/api/promote-task`)
- [x] Create promotion destination selection dialog
- [x] Build new loop file creation from promotion
- [x] Add task metadata preservation during promotion
- [x] Implement execution log appending in target files
- [x] Update source plan with promotion status and links
- [x] Add "Plan" badge display for promoted tasks in executor
- [ ] Add batch promotion for multiple tasks
- [ ] Implement promotion rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create promotion audit trail and history

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Task promotion architecture defined and linked to semantic planner and executor interface
- 2025-09-01: Implemented the task promotion feature.
    - Added "Promote to Execution" button in the Task Board UI.
    - Created a dialog for users to select a promotion destination (new or existing loop).
    - Developed an API endpoint (`/api/promote-task`) to handle the promotion logic, including:
        - Creating new loop files or updating existing ones.
        - Appending the task and an execution log entry to the target file.
    - Updated the source `workstream_plan.md` to mark tasks as `status: promoted` and add a `promoted_to` link.
    - Modified the Task Executor view to display a "Plan" badge for tasks promoted from the workstream plan.
