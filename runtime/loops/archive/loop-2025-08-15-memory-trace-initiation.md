# Memory Trace Initiation

This loop focused on extending the Task Executor UI and loop architecture to support persistent execution memory.

## üìù TODO

- [x] Modify the loop mutation function to store execution traces.
- [x] Add a `## üß† Memory Trace` section to loop markdown files.
- [x] Append a memory block for each "Completed" or "Run" action.
- [x] Parse and match memory traces to tasks.
- [x] Render memory traces in a collapsible section in the UI.
- [x] Use a `Badge` to visually distinguish tasks with memory.

## üß† Thoughts

The implementation was successful. The backend API now correctly appends structured memory traces to the loop files. The biggest improvement was refactoring the `/api/tasks` endpoint to embed these traces directly with the task data, which simplified the frontend logic considerably by removing the need for separate data-fetching calls when expanding a task. The UI now clearly indicates which tasks have a history and displays that history on demand.

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07T05:00:00Z: Corrected malformed frontmatter in a loop file that was causing parsing errors.
- 2025-06-07T05:05:00Z: Extended the `/api/complete-task` and `/api/run-task` routes to append structured memory traces to loop files.
- 2025-06-07T05:10:00Z: Modified the `/api/tasks` route to parse memory traces and embed them with their corresponding tasks.
- 2025-06-07T05:15:00Z: Added the `Badge` component from shadcn/ui.
- 2025-06-07T05:20:00Z: Refactored the `TaskExecutor` component to display memory traces from the task data and indicate their presence with a badge.
- 2025-06-07T05:25:00Z: Confirmed end-to-end functionality in the browser.
