summary: |
  This loop introduces test coverage for Ora's UI mutation interfaces, especially around task promotion and markdown mutation flows. It aims to prevent regressions, recover from render failure states, and validate task integrity before execution.
---

## Purpose

To reinforce Ora's Task Board and Task Executor UIs with robust test coverage, guarding against repeated failure states, broken context loops in Cursor, and improper file mutations. This loop focuses on render resilience, semantic guardrails, and mutation preview logic.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Write Jest test for Task Board render with valid plan
- [ ] Write test for promotion button presence and UI state mutation
- [ ] Add mock file system interface to simulate `workstream_plan.md` read/write
- [ ] Write test to reject task promotion if required metadata (`source`, `status`) is missing
- [ ] Validate markdown mutation before write (pre-check for checklist block or target section)
- [ ] Create fallback renderer test for failed loop loads
