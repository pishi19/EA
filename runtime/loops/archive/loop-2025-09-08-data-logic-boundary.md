summary: |
  This loop establishes a hard boundary between Ora's execution logic and its semantic data files. It aims to prevent future regressions, silent data corruption, or feature collisions by ensuring all logic operates through structured, validated mutation contracts, and that markdown files remain semantically valid, traceable data.
---

## Purpose

To protect Ora's structural coherence by enforcing a separation between logic and data. UI components, GPT reasoning, and API routes should interact with `.md` files through tested, controlled mutation layers â€” never through unbounded rewrites or silent assumptions. This ensures the stability and long-term integrity of the system.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Define the mutation interface for `.md` files (append, field-patch, replace-by-anchor)
- [ ] Prohibit GPT or UI logic from rewriting entire markdown bodies
- [ ] Require schema validation before any write
- [ ] Add dry-run mutation testing for UI/GPT actions
- [ ] Structure logs to track pre-image/post-image diff for every mutation
- [ ] Ensure parsing logic never mutates source files directly

---

## ðŸ”’ Semantic Contracts

- All logic operates on parsed representations
- Mutation always flows through a validated interface
- Files are the system of record; mutations respect their structure
- Schema drift or malformed sections must be surfaced, not silently ignored

- [ ] Establish API contracts between layers
- [ ] Add boundary validation and enforcement
- [ ] Document architecture boundary principles
- [ ] Test boundary integrity across components
