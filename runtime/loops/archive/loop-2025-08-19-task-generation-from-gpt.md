title: Task Generation from Memory and Reasoning
phase: 9.0
workstream: reasoning
status: in_progress
score: 0.9
tags: [task-generation, gpt, memory, next-step, agentic]

origin: reasoning-extension
summary: |
  This loop extends Ora's reasoning layer by enabling GPT to generate new tasks based on past memory traces and current loop context. It allows suggestions to become structured tasks and closes the GPT feedback loop from insight to execution.
---

## Purpose

To allow GPT to take memory-informed reasoning and propose concrete next steps as structured tasks. These generated tasks can then be reviewed, edited, promoted into loop checklists, and executed through Ora's standard UI loop.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Use GPT reasoning output to propose next-step tasks
- [x] Allow user to promote GPT suggestions into loop checklist format
- [x] Support inline or modal editing before saving
- [x] Update loop `.md` file and execution log accordingly
- [x] Display promoted tasks in UI with "GPT-origin" indicator

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [x] Implement GPT-driven task suggestion API endpoint
- [x] Create UI components for task suggestion and promotion
- [x] Add "Suggest Task" button with context-aware prompting
- [x] Build task editing modal for suggestion refinement
- [x] Implement task promotion to loop file mutation
- [x] Add "GPT" badge display for promoted tasks in UI
- [ ] Add session context for cross-loop task suggestions
- [ ] Implement task suggestion quality scoring

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-08-19: Implemented GPT-driven task suggestion and promotion. The UI now features a "Suggest Task" button, which calls a new API to get a task suggestion based on the loop's summary and context. The suggestion can be edited, accepted, or discarded. Accepted tasks are added to the loop file under `## ðŸ”§ Tasks` and a log of the promotion is added to the `## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log`. The UI now displays a "GPT" badge next to these tasks.
- 2025-06-07: Loop created to support GPT-driven task generation from semantic memory
