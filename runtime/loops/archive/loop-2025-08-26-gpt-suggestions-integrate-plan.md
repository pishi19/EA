phase: 10.0
workstream: reasoning
status: complete

tags: [gpt, reasoning, planning, workstream, grounding]

origin: user-request
summary: |
  This loop updates the Ora reasoning system to ensure all GPT task suggestions are grounded in the central workstream plan. GPT will now parse the existing plan, deduplicate against open tasks, and propose suggestions as either extensions to existing items or as new, justified tasks that fill a clear gap.
---

## Purpose

To make GPT suggestions more relevant and integrated by requiring them to be based on the master `workstream_plan.md`. This prevents disconnected or redundant suggestions and ensures all proposed tasks align with the established plan.

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [x] Locate and parse `workstream_plan.md`.
- [x] Update the GPT suggestion logic to use the plan as context.
- [x] Ensure new suggestions are either refinements of existing tasks or are new tasks with clear justification.
- [x] Add `added_by: ora` and a `context:` field to new suggestions.
- [x] Surface the grounded suggestions in a UI with accept/reject/edit controls.
- [x] Create an API to promote accepted suggestions back to the `workstream_plan.md` file.
- [x] Log the implementation in this loop file.

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-08-26: Implemented the full workflow for grounded GPT suggestions. Created a new Planning View UI, a suggestion API that reads the workstream plan for context, and a promotion API to add accepted tasks to the plan.
- 2025-08-26: Loop created to ground GPT suggestions in the workstream plan.
- 2025-06-07T09:03:35.168Z: Task ‚ÄúIntegrate GPT suggestions with planning board interface‚Äù run via UI. Reasoning: Simulated reasoning for task "Integrate GPT suggestions with planning board interface" in loop "GPT Task Suggestions Grounded in Workstream Plan". The plan is to execute the following steps...

## üîß Tasks

- [ ] Integrate GPT suggestions with planning board interface
