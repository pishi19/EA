title: Test Coverage Recovery & Enclosure â€“ 100% Execution Contract

summary: |
  This loop reintroduces test coverage as a structured Ora task following a failed attempt outside the agentic loop system. Cursor exited execution responsibility without mutation or fallback. This loop logs that deviation and now defines a path toward full test coverage for the Yellow Slice UI.
---

## Purpose

To recover from a failed testing implementation attempt and establish a structured path toward achieving 100% test coverage for the React-based Task Executor UI within Ora's loop-driven execution model.

## ðŸ§­ Context

The user requested 100% test coverage for the React-based Task Executor UI. This was executed outside the loop contract. Cursor failed to deliver a working test harness and terminated with the message:

> "I am stuck in a loop... I have failed to deliver... I apologize..."

This violated Ora's principles:
- No file mutation
- No checklist update
- No fallback plan
- No execution trace

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Recover from version mismatch (`React Element from an older version`)
- [ ] Create a functional Jest test config for `TaskExecutor.tsx`
- [ ] Ensure shadcn/ui + Tailwind styles render in test env
- [ ] Use `@testing-library/react` for unit + snapshot + interaction tests
- [ ] Achieve 100% test coverage for TaskExecutor page and components
- [ ] Mutate the loop file with pass/fail status for each task

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

### 1. Environment Fix
- [ ] Inspect `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for multiple React versions
- [ ] Ensure test dependencies (e.g. `@testing-library/react`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `identity-obj-proxy`) match the app React version

### 2. Jest Setup
- [ ] Create or fix `jest.config.ts`
- [ ] Ensure CSS modules, Tailwind, and component imports are transformed correctly
- [ ] Use `jsdom` as test environment

### 3. Component Tests
- [ ] Write `TaskExecutor.test.tsx` to test:
  - Rendering of filtered task lists
  - Presence of source loop metadata
  - Run and Complete button behavior
  - Filter dropdown state and response

### 4. Snapshot Coverage
- [ ] Add snapshot tests for at least 2 filter states

### 5. Coverage Report
- [ ] Add `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"` to `package.json`
- [ ] Ensure 100% statements, branches, and lines in coverage output

## ðŸ”„ Execution Plan

1. Log this loop
2. Scaffold/fix `jest.config.ts` inside the React app
3. Write isolated tests for `TaskExecutor.tsx`
4. Run `npm run test:coverage`
5. If coverage <100%, log uncovered areas and create a sub-loop
6. Otherwise, mark all tasks above as complete

---

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
- 2025-06-07: Test framework reinstalled, Jest configured, component tests written and passing, including snapshot tests. Full test coverage achieved except for Radix UI Select component, which fails under JSDOM due to missing browser APIs (`hasPointerCapture`, `scrollIntoView`). Snapshot updated. All other tasks marked complete. Radix testing issue deferred to a follow-up loop.
- 2025-06-07: User attempted full Jest integration and 100% coverage. Testing environment failed irreparably due to version mismatches and structural incompatibility. All test infra removed (test files, config, packages, scripts) to restore application baseline. Testing status: blocked. New diagnostic loop required.

- 2025-06-07: Loop created after failed off-loop test execution attempt
