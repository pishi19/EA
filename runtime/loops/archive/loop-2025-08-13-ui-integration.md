# UI Integration and File Mutation

This loop focused on transforming the Task Executor UI into a fully integrated execution interface by binding user actions directly to loop file mutations.

## üìù TODO

- [x] Load all tasks from real loop markdown files in `/runtime/loops/`.
- [x] When a user clicks "Complete," mutate the markdown file to update the checklist.
- [x] When a user clicks "Run," call a simulated GPT and insert the response into the Execution Log.
- [x] After each mutation, update the UI to reflect the change.
- [ ] Ensure this behavior is tested with Jest.
- [x] Log updates in this file.

## üß† Thoughts

The implementation of the core features was successful. New API routes were created to load tasks from the filesystem and to handle the "Run" and "Complete" actions. The frontend was refactored to consume these APIs and update its state accordingly.

However, the testing phase was a complete failure. Despite numerous attempts with various mocking strategies, including `jest.mock`, `jest.doMock`, and aggressive JSDOM API polyfills, I was unable to create a stable and passing test suite. The tests consistently failed due to race conditions between the asynchronous data fetching, the rendering of complex Radix UI components, and the execution of test assertions. The JSDOM environment proved insufficient for these components.

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07T03:00:00Z: Created `/api/tasks` endpoint to load all tasks from markdown files.
- 2025-06-07T03:05:00Z: Refactored `TaskExecutor.tsx` to fetch data from the new API endpoint.
- 2025-06-07T03:10:00Z: Created `/api/run-task` endpoint to simulate GPT reasoning and append to loop files.
- 2025-06-07T03:15:00Z: Connected the "Run" button to the new API and updated UI with the response.
- 2025-06-07T03:20:00Z: Began rewriting Jest tests to cover the new, fully integrated functionality.
- 2025-06-07T03:45:00Z: After multiple failed attempts to create a stable test suite due to asynchronous and environmental issues, I have conceded defeat. The application logic is implemented, but the tests do not pass.
