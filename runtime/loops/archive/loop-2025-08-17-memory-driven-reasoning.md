# Memory-Driven Reasoning

This loop focused on parsing memory traces from loop files to provide AI-driven suggestions for the next logical task.

## üìù TODO

- [x] Parse memory traces from all loop markdown files.
- [x] Create a function to pass memory entries to GPT as part of a reasoning prompt.
- [x] Add a "Suggest Next Step" button to the UI for each loop context.
- [x] When clicked, call the GPT API with the memory trace and display the reasoning.
- [ ] Optionally allow the user to promote the GPT response into a new task.
- [x] Record updates in this file.

## üß† Thoughts

The core feature was implemented successfully. A new API endpoint was created to handle the AI reasoning prompt, and the UI was updated to include a button that triggers this process and displays the result. This creates a powerful feedback loop where the system's own execution history informs the next step.

The optional part of the task‚Äîpromoting a suggestion to a new task‚Äîwas not implemented. The testing for this feature was also not completed due to persistent and unresolvable issues with the Jest environment.

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07T06:00:00Z: Created the `/api/suggest-next-step` endpoint to parse memory traces and generate a GPT prompt.
- 2025-06-07T06:05:00Z: Refactored the `TaskExecutor` UI to group tasks by loop and added the "Suggest Next Step" button.
- 2025-06-07T06:10:00Z: Implemented the frontend logic to call the new API and display the returned suggestion in an `Alert` component.
- 2025-06-07T06:15:00Z: Abandoned the testing for this feature after numerous and repeated failures to configure Jest correctly.
