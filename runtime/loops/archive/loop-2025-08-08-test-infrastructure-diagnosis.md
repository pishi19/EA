### Analysis of `package.json`

- **Location:** `src/ui/react-app/package.json`
- **Findings:**
    - The `package.json` file was parsed to identify installed dependencies.
    - **No testing libraries (`jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `ts-jest`) are currently installed in the project.**
    - The project uses `next: 14.2.4`, `react: ^18`, and `react-dom: ^18`.
- **Conclusion:** The test environment is not failing; it is completely missing.

### Recommended Minimal Viable Test Setup

To establish a stable testing environment for a Next.js 14 (with App Router) and React 18 project, the following dependencies are recommended. This setup avoids known compatibility issues.

- **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework.
- **`jest-environment-jsdom`:** Provides a DOM environment for Jest.
- **`@testing-library/react`:** Provides utilities for testing React components.
- **`@testing-library/jest-dom`:** Adds custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
- **`ts-jest`:** A TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest.

This is a foundational setup. You can install these as `devDependencies` and then create `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` to configure the test environment.
