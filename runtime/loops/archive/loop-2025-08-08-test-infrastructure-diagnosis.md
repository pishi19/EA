summary: |
  This loop investigates the deep failure of the React/Jest testing environment. The testing system was unable to render Ora's React components reliably, due to unresolved compatibility issues between package versions and test libraries. All test infra was rolled back. This loop seeks to isolate and diagnose the root incompatibilities before any retry is attempted.
---

## Purpose

To investigate and diagnose the root causes of React/Jest testing environment failures that prevented successful test implementation for Ora's Task Executor UI.

## ✅ Objectives

- [ ] Identify specific version conflicts in React testing ecosystem
- [ ] Document incompatible package combinations
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix for testing dependencies
- [ ] Propose minimal viable test setup
- [ ] Establish clear path forward for testing infrastructure

## 📘 Context

The attempt to establish 100% test coverage for Ora's React Task Executor UI failed and triggered full rollback. The environment was broken in a way that caused persistent React compatibility errors, and Cursor could not recover or resolve them. Testing has been removed to preserve application functionality.

---

## 🔧 Tasks

- [ ] Inspect actual React version in `package.json`
- [ ] Parse all versions of React-related libraries in `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`
- [ ] Identify conflicting versions in:
  - `react`
  - `react-dom`
  - `@testing-library/react`
  - `jest` / `ts-jest`
- [ ] Create a compatibility matrix for minimum viable test setup
- [ ] Propose a minimal set of test dependencies that will work in isolation
- [ ] Rebuild Jest environment from clean baseline once diagnosis is complete

---

## 🔁 Next Step

No testing attempts should be made until this diagnostic loop is complete and a stable environment is confirmed.
