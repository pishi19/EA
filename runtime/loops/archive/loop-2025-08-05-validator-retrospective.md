title: Retrospective ‚Äì Validator Setup & Execution Discipline
phase: 8.1
workstream: system-integrity
status: complete
score: 0.95
tags: [retrospective, execution-integrity, phase-8, validator, learning]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: reflection
summary: |
  This retrospective captures key lessons from introducing Ora's validator scripts. It reflects on why explicit verification, testable execution, and loop-to-action linkage are non-negotiable standards. The event reinforces Ora's core principle: loops are the canonical source of truth.
---

## Purpose

To conduct a comprehensive retrospective on the validator setup process and establish execution discipline learnings for future phase development.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [x] Analyze validator introduction process and outcomes
- [x] Document key insights about execution integrity
- [x] Establish execution discipline standards
- [x] Validate loop-as-truth principle through system failures
- [x] Create framework for future execution verification

## üß≠ What Happened

During Phase 8.1 development of the Task Executor UI, a task was completed and acknowledged by the assistant, but never mutated in the corresponding loop file. This surfaced a deeper problem: Ora lacked verification to ensure assistant claims, human actions, and system state were fully aligned.

## üîç What We Learned

| Area | Insight |
|------|---------|
| **Loops ‚â† State** | If a loop isn't mutated, Ora has no proof a task was executed |
| **GPT ‚â† Ground Truth** | The assistant can describe actions, but it must *mutate files* to make them real |
| **Git ‚â† Plan** | Git may reflect changes, but not purpose unless loop UUIDs are referenced |
| **Execution = Task + Trace** | Real execution includes the change, the checklist update, and a log entry |
| **Environment Matters** | Validators must run inside Ora's actual project context to function fully |

## üîß Tasks

- [x] Created two validator scripts:
  - `validate_loop_task_status.py` (loop ‚Üí file check)
  - `validate_git_task_links.py` (Git ‚Üí loop link check)
- [x] Registered both in `loop-2025-08-03-validator-registration.md`
- [x] Executed both (controlled test failed in sandbox)
- [x] Captured findings in `loop-2025-08-04-validator-findings.md`
- [x] Built a formal execution framework in `loop-2025-08-02-phase-8-standards.md`

---

## üîÑ Follow-Up Tasks

- [ ] Integrate validators into live Ora project CI or CLI
- [ ] Rerun validators from within Cursor/git context
- [ ] Backfill any orphan tasks or loop mismatches
- [ ] Treat validator failures as Ora errors, not environment bugs
