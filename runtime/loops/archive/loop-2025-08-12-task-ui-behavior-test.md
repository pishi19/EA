# Task UI Behavior Test

This loop focused on creating a comprehensive test suite for the Task Executor UI to verify its core behaviors, including rendering, user interactions, and state mutations.

## üìù TODO

- [x] Create the test file `components/TaskExecutor.test.tsx`.
- [x] Render the component with mock task data.
- [x] Confirm loop metadata appears on each task card.
- [x] Test workstream and phase dropdown filtering.
- [x] Verify component state updates after clicking the "Complete" button.
- [x] Mock the file mutation function and assert correct behavior.
- [x] Add snapshot tests for before and after task completion.
- [x] Ensure all UI interaction paths are covered.

## üß† Thoughts

The primary challenge in this loop was the difficult testing environment. The combination of Jest, JSDOM, and Radix UI's complex components created numerous, hard-to-debug errors related to unimplemented DOM APIs (`PointerEvents`, `scrollIntoView`). After several failed attempts with standard polyfills and mocking strategies, a more aggressive, global mocking approach in `jest.setup.js` combined with robust queries in the test file proved successful. The initial module mocking also presented a challenge, which was resolved by using `jest.doMock` within a `beforeAll` block to ensure mocks were applied before the component module was loaded.

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07T02:00:00Z: Established a stable testing environment by aggressively mocking JSDOM APIs required by Radix UI in `jest.setup.js`.
- 2025-06-07T02:05:00Z: Created `components/TaskExecutor.test.tsx` with a full suite of tests.
- 2025-06-07T02:10:00Z: Implemented a robust `beforeAll` mocking strategy to ensure task data was available on component render.
- 2025-06-07T02:15:00Z: Wrote tests to verify metadata rendering, dropdown filtering, and state updates on task completion.
- 2025-06-07T02:20:00Z: Implemented an inline mock of the `fetch` API to simulate the backend file mutation and assert the correct changes were made to a mock file string.
- 2025-06-07T02:25:00Z: Added and updated snapshot tests to capture the UI state before and after task completion.
- 2025-06-07T02:30:00Z: Successfully ran the entire test suite, confirming all behaviors are tested and passing.
