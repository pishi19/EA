title: Finalize Tests for UI-Driven Loop Mutation and Execution Logs
phase: 8.4

summary: |
  This loop closes the remaining test coverage for Ora's UI task mutation and loop synchronization. It focuses on stabilizing the tests that validate real file mutations, checklist updates, and execution log integration from the Task Executor UI.
---

## Purpose

To ensure that the critical mutation and reasoning workflows in Ora's UI are verifiably correct and robust by completing and stabilizing the associated test coverage.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Test UI loading of loop data
- [ ] Verify mutation logic triggers and updates `.md` files
- [ ] Confirm execution log entries are written
- [ ] Snapshot task list before and after `Complete`
- [ ] Assert filter state after task mutation
- [ ] Document unstable test areas if still unresolved

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Write unit tests for loop data loading
- [ ] Create integration tests for mutation logic
- [ ] Test execution log writing functionality
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing for UI state changes
- [ ] Validate filter behavior after mutations
- [ ] Document Jest environment limitations and workarounds
- [ ] Create fallback testing strategy if Jest remains unstable

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
- 2025-06-07: TaskExecutor mutation and log features are fully implemented and functional in the UI. However, all efforts to stabilize the test suite failed due to an intractable `moduleNameMapper` resolution issue in the Jest environment. Despite alignment with `tsconfig.json` and multiple transform attempts, Jest could not resolve aliased paths (e.g., `@/components/ui`) within ESM and mixed module environments. This loop is complete with unresolved test failures logged. Further efforts should be redirected to the follow-up loop for isolating Jest pathing issues.

- 2025-06-07: Loop created to close test coverage for UI mutation and log integration
