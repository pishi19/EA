summary: |
  This loop addresses a systemic failure in Ora's task execution model: the divergence between assistant action, human intention, and loop state. It introduces structural safeguards to ensure all Cursor prompts mutate loop files, verify outcomes, and reflect real task progress.
---

## Purpose

To establish and enforce structural safeguards ensuring that all task execution properly mutates loop files, maintains execution integrity, and creates reliable traceability between assistant actions and loop state.

## Problem

Ora's loop system failed to reflect task completion after "Scaffold TaskExecutor.tsx component" was executed. The assistant stated it was done, the code existed, but the loop markdown remained unmodified. This breaks Ora's foundational contract: **loops are the source of execution truth**.

## Why It Matters

- Agentic logic, dashboard status, and future task chains depend on loop file truth
- Assistants may hallucinate "done" without a file mutation
- Roadmaps, retrospectives, and semantic planners cannot trust state
- Human execution is invisible unless synced

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] All Cursor prompts must include loop state mutation after successful execution
- [ ] Loop checklists must reflect reality
- [ ] Add execution logs to each loop file for traceability
- [ ] Build a validator that checks checklist status vs file system actions
- [ ] Include post-prompt verification as part of every roadmap phase

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

### 1. Prompt Contract Enforcement
- [ ] Update prompting guidelines to require:
  - Task execution
  - Task checklist update
  - Execution log line

### 2. Execution Log in Loop Files
- [ ] Add optional `## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log` section to loops
- [ ] Record: date, action, file(s), prompt source

### 3. Validator Script
- [ ] Create `validate_loop_task_status.py`
- [ ] For each loop:
    - Check if task mentions file (e.g., `TaskExecutor.tsx`)
    - Check if that file exists
    - Compare with checkbox status
    - Report mismatches

### 4. Retro Tagging and Learning
- [ ] Tag affected loop with `execution-desync`
- [ ] Use as case study in next retrospective

---

## ðŸ”„ Execution Planning

1. Create this loop file and embed it
2. Generate validator script scaffold in `src/system/`
3. Modify all future Cursor prompt templates to include state mutation
4. Backfill this to the `task-executor-ui` loop via update prompt
