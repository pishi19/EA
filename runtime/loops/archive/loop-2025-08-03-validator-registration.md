title: Validator Scripts Registered for Loop + Git Consistency
phase: 8.1
workstream: system-integrity
status: complete
score: 0.95
tags: [validator, loop-sync, git-audit, execution-integrity, tooling]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: loop-integrity
summary: |
  This loop registers and formalizes two validation scriptsâ€”`validate_loop_task_status.py` and `validate_git_task_links.py`â€”used to ensure Ora's task checklists, file changes, and Git commits stay semantically in sync. These scripts are now operational and tracked as part of Phase 8 standards.
---

## Purpose

To ensure Ora's execution and mutation process is structurally sound by detecting desynchronization between loop tasks, actual file changes, and Git commit trails.

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Register validator scripts for loop-file consistency checking
- [x] Ensure Git commit linkage to loop UUIDs is traceable
- [x] Establish tooling for execution integrity verification
- [ ] Integrate validators into CI or regular review process

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Registered

### 1. `validate_loop_task_status.py`
- Checks if tasks in loop `.md` files that reference `.tsx` or `.py` files have matching file state
- Flags if a file exists but the checklist is not marked as complete, or vice versa

### 2. `validate_git_task_links.py`
- Scans Git commit history
- Flags any commits that do not include a reference to a `loop-YYYY-MM-DD` UUID

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [x] Store scripts under `src/system/`
- [x] Add to Ora prompt contract documentation
- [x] Verify both scripts return output or clean pass
- [ ] Add validator checks to Phase 8.2 entry checklist
- [ ] Schedule regular execution in CI or local review script
