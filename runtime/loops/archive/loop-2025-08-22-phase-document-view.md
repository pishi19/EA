title: "Phase Document View: A Unified Journal for System Execution"
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-ui
status: complete
score: 1.0
tags: [phase-document, ui, journal-view, execution-context]
created: 2025-08-22
origin: phase-10.0-objectives
summary: |
  This loop creates a new page that renders the entire in-progress phase as a single, scrollable document. It combines the phase definition with the full content of all its associated loops, creating a "living document" that serves as the primary human-readable interface for understanding and reasoning about the system's current execution.
---

## Purpose

To provide a unified, document-centric view of the current phase, moving beyond a dashboard metaphor to a journal-like interface. This view will aggregate all relevant information into a single, scrollable page to facilitate a holistic understanding of the system's activities.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Create a new page at `/app/phase-doc/page.tsx`.
- [x] Scan `/runtime/phases/` to find and load the `in_progress` phase.
- [x] Render the phase header, body, and checklist.
- [x] For each associated loop, render its full content, including tasks and logs.
- [x] Use collapsible sections for each loop to manage complexity.
- [x] Style the page to feel like a readable document or journal.
- [x] Add an optional GPT commentary section at the end.
- [x] Log the implementation in this file and mark objectives as complete.

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-08-22: Implemented the Phase Document View. Created a new API endpoint to serve the active phase and all its associated loop data. Built a new page at `/phase-doc` that renders this data in a unified, scrollable, journal-style format, with collapsible sections for each loop.
- 2025-08-22: Loop created to implement the Phase Document View. 

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Create phase document parsing and rendering logic
- [ ] Implement markdown-to-UI component mapping
- [ ] Add phase navigation and breadcrumb system
- [ ] Build phase progress visualization
- [ ] Create cross-phase link navigation
- [ ] Add phase editing capabilities (if needed)
- [ ] Implement phase document search and filtering
