title: Task Board UI Parse Debug â€“ Surface Silent Failures and API Response Mismatches
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.85
tags: [ui-debug, task-board, parser, api-response, fallback]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: post-audit
summary: |
  This loop investigates why the Task Board UI remains empty despite successful runtime validation, correct file paths, and valid markdown schema. It focuses on API response structure, UI rendering expectations, and surfacing silent parse failures.
---

## Purpose

To trace the failure in the Task Board UI caused by frontend parser expectations or API format mismatches. This loop bridges the remaining gap between structural correctness and user-visible functionality by logging, surfacing, and correcting task array render logic.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Dump raw API response to console or debug panel from `/api/plan-tasks`
- [ ] Log the result of the plan parser (array of tasks) to confirm structure
- [ ] Add UI-side fallback to display warning if task list is empty or malformed
- [ ] Confirm that the tasks array includes: `description`, `source`, `status`, `added_by`
- [ ] Validate that UI filters (e.g. pending tasks) are not hiding valid entries
- [ ] Render diagnostic error if parsing fails silently

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Loop created to surface final UI failure preventing Task Board display after full runtime audit and path validation

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Debug task board UI parsing issues
- [ ] Identify and fix data parsing errors
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for UI parsing
- [ ] Add validation for task board data structures
- [ ] Create debugging tools for parsing workflow
- [ ] Test parsing across different data formats
- [ ] Document parsing requirements and constraints
