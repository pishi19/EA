title: Runtime Path Audit â€“ Resolve Broken Loop and API Access
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.8

summary: |
  This loop performs a full audit of Ora's runtime directory and associated API routes to resolve persistent file access failures. It targets failures in task loading, plan reading, and execution file promotion, caused by incorrect path resolution or malformed content.
---

## Purpose

To eliminate ENOENT and loop drift errors in Ora's task planner and executor by auditing all runtime folder paths, checking file presence, structure, and access patterns, and verifying that API routes resolve files correctly using BASE_DIR semantics.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Verify existence and structure of all runtime folders:
    - `/runtime/workstreams/roadmap/`
    - `/runtime/loops/`
    - `/runtime/phases/`
- [ ] Confirm `workstream_plan.md` is accessible and correctly formatted
- [ ] Check all loop files referenced by `loop-*.md`
- [ ] Confirm all `task-*.md` files exist in expected `tasks/` directories
- [ ] Validate `BASE_DIR` resolution logic in all five API routes
- [ ] Manually test API route responses for task loading and promotion
- [ ] Add fallback error logging to route.ts files where missing

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Audit loop initiated after repeated file resolution failures in Cursor during task board recovery

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Audit runtime path configurations and dependencies
- [ ] Identify path resolution issues and conflicts
- [ ] Document current runtime path structure
- [ ] Propose path optimization strategies
- [ ] Implement path standardization improvements
- [ ] Test path changes across environments
- [ ] Update documentation with new path standards
