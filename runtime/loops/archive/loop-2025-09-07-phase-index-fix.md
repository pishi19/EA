title: Fix Phase Index Rendering in UI â€“ Restore Full Phase Visibility
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.85
tags: [ui, phase-index, roadmap, visibility, rendering]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: ui-inconsistency
summary: |
  This loop addresses a known issue where the Phase Doc View and System View UI only display a partial set of phases. Only phases 8.2, 8.4, and 9 are currently rendered. The goal is to restore full visibility of all declared roadmap phases, including the newly completed Phase 10.0.
---

## Purpose

To correct the UI component that parses and renders phase files so that all defined phases in `/runtime/phases/` or `system_roadmap.yaml` are consistently shown. This ensures the full execution history and current roadmap context are visible.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Parse all `phase-*.md` files from `/runtime/phases/`
- [ ] Or load all phases from `system_roadmap.yaml`
- [ ] Display both `status: in_progress` and `status: complete`
- [ ] Ensure all phases are sorted by `phase:` field (8.0 â†’ 10.0)
- [ ] Match phase files to associated loop files and render them in the UI
- [ ] Confirm Phase 10.0 appears and links to its loops

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Phase rendering issue identified; fix loop initiated to correct missing Phase 10.0 in UI view

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Audit phase index files for consistency
- [ ] Fix missing or incorrect phase references
- [ ] Ensure proper phase sorting (8.0 â†’ 10.0)
- [ ] Validate phase file linking and navigation
- [ ] Update phase documentation structure
- [ ] Test phase index functionality
- [ ] Document phase indexing standards
