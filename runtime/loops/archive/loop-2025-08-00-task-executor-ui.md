created: 2025-06-07
origin: roadmap
summary: |
  This loop initiates the development of the Green slice for Ora's Task Executor UI. It delivers a static task review interface where the user can manually trigger GPT-executed actions, without context memory or backend systems. It serves as the foundational execution interface for Ora's future agentic capabilities.
---

## Purpose

To establish the first functional vertical slice of Ora's agentic execution system: a UI for humans to inspect and manually trigger GPT-generated tasks. This forms the üü¢ Green tier of the Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Blue development model.

## Scope

- **Frontend only:** built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Static task list:** UI shows predefined or inline-generated tasks
- **Trigger execution manually:** clicking a button initiates the GPT call
- **No backend, no persistence, no state memory**
- **GPT calls can be mocked or executed live depending on dev mode**

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [x] Render static list of example tasks
- [ ] Use shadcn/ui components for task display and actions
- [ ] Each task includes metadata: description, source, optional context
- [ ] Include buttons for "Run Task", "View Reasoning" (mocked)
- [ ] Support stateful feedback for UI only (executed/not, output shown)
- [ ] Encapsulate logic in a reusable component

---

## üîß Tasks

### 1. Interface Layout
- [x] Scaffold `TaskExecutor.tsx` component
- [ ] Add page route: `/task-executor`
- [ ] Setup Tailwind layout (grid or flex with sidebar/header optional)

### 2. Static Task List
- [ ] Define mock `taskList` array with example entries:
  - title, description, source, status
- [ ] Render with shadcn/ui components (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`)

### 3. Task Execution Button
- [ ] Add `Run` button per task
- [ ] Mock GPT call on click (with artificial delay and fake output)
- [ ] Update UI state (e.g., "executing", "done", "error")

### 4. Reasoning Modal (Optional)
- [ ] Add expandable or modal view with "GPT Reasoning"
- [ ] Populate with placeholder/fake LLM-generated reasoning
- [ ] Display using `Dialog` or `Accordion`

### 5. Feedback Controls (UI only)
- [ ] Add "Was this helpful?" toggle or emoji bar
- [ ] Store locally in component state

## üîÑ Execution Planning ‚Äì Next Steps

1. **Design Phase**
   - [ ] Define schema for a task object (ID, title, description, status, result)
   - [ ] Mock 3‚Äì5 example tasks with varied content

2. **Code Scaffold**
   - [ ] Setup a new UI page/component under `pages/task-executor.tsx`
   - [ ] Implement main layout using Tailwind + shadcn/ui
   - [ ] Add navbar link (if applicable)

3. **Mock LLM Trigger**
   - [ ] Create `runTask(task)` function that simulates a GPT response
   - [ ] Include artificial delay to simulate real-time generation

4. **Interaction Loop**
   - [ ] Mark task as "executed" once the response arrives
   - [ ] Allow the user to view/hide results
   - [ ] Store state in local component for now

## üîÅ Notes

This is the first direct instantiation of Ora's agentic loop pattern. While GPT calls are mocked, the UI should prepare for:
- Task metadata richness
- Reasoning traces (later backed by LLM)
- Multi-task sequencing (in Yellow/Blue)

This loop anchors Ora's shift from dashboarding to intelligent execution. A successful Green slice becomes the foundation for project-linked context, state memory, and autonomous reasoning to follow.
