title: Task Completion â†’ Loop File Mutation

summary: |
  This loop enables task completion in Ora's Task Executor UI to write back into the original loop markdown file. It closes the execution loop: UI triggers change, assistant updates state, system reflects execution truth. This is a core mechanic of Ora's agentic architecture.
---

## Purpose

To connect Ora's live Task Executor interface with the source `.md` loop files, enabling execution events (e.g. marking a task "Completed") to be persisted into the original YAML/Markdown source. This validates loop-driven architecture and allows Qdrant, Git, and UI to stay fully in sync.

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Identify loop source file path from task metadata (via UUID)
- [ ] Parse markdown loop file and locate matching checklist line
- [ ] Update `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed task in loop file
- [ ] Append line to `## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log` section
- [ ] Persist updated markdown file
- [ ] Confirm updated state is reflected in live UI

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Add `uuid` field to each task in the frontend state
- [ ] On "Complete" button click, send mutation request to backend
- [ ] Create mutation function to:
    - Load the loop `.md` file by UUID
    - Match the checklist line text
    - Replace `[ ]` with `[x]`
    - Add entry in execution log
- [ ] Update the UI state after mutation
- [ ] Optional: re-embed updated loop into Qdrant

---

## ðŸ”„ Execution Planning

1. Move this loop to `/runtime/loops/`
2. Embed in Qdrant
3. Create backend endpoint or local mutation function
4. Hook up frontend to send task ID + UUID + description
5. Test with a known loop file (e.g. `loop-2025-08-02-phase-8-standards.md`)
6. Log result and reflect mutation in the UI
