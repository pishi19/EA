# Task Mutation from UI

This loop focuses on extending the Task Executor UI to allow mutating loop markdown files directly from the web interface.

## üìù TODO

- [x] Create a backend API endpoint to handle task completion.
- [x] Implement filesystem logic to read, modify, and save markdown files.
- [x] Refactor the frontend to manage tasks in a state variable.
- [x] Add a "Complete" button to the UI and connect it to the backend API.
- [x] Trigger the Qdrant embedding update script after a successful mutation.
- [ ] Ensure the UI provides clear feedback on success or failure.
- [ ] Thoroughly test the end-to-end functionality.

## üß† Thoughts

The main challenge is coordinating the frontend UI with the backend filesystem mutations. The API needs to be robust enough to handle file I/O errors, and the frontend needs to optimistically update the UI and handle potential API failures gracefully. The optional Qdrant update should be handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI response.
