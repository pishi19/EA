phase: 9.0

summary: |
  This loop captures the unresolved test coverage for GPT reasoning logic based on memory traces. The feature is implemented and working, but tests could not be stabilized due to environment and linter issues. All test actions are deferred to this loop for future resolution.
---

## Purpose

To establish comprehensive test coverage for the memory-driven GPT reasoning pipeline, ensuring that memory trace parsing, prompt generation, and output handling are properly validated.

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Develop test strategy for memory trace parsing logic
- [ ] Create unit tests for GPT prompt generation from task memory
- [ ] Establish integration tests for reasoning UI components
- [ ] Validate memory-to-reasoning pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Document test environment limitations and workarounds

## Context

The GPT reasoning pipeline over memory traces is functional and live. However, unit and integration test coverage for this behavior failed due to persistent Jest environment issues. This loop isolates those test cases for future resolution without blocking the reasoning pipeline.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Write unit tests for memory trace parsing
- [ ] Test GPT prompt generation from task memory
- [ ] Validate UI response rendering of GPT results
- [ ] Test "Promote to Task" feature (if implemented)
- [ ] Log reasons for any skipped coverage
- [ ] Create mock strategies for GPT API interactions
- [ ] Establish test data sets for memory trace scenarios
