title: Phase 10.0 Initiation â€“ Architecture and Agentic Integration
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.9
tags: [phase-transition, architecture, agentic, integration]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: phase-shift
summary: |
  This loop marks the formal completion of Phase 9.0 and the initiation of Phase 10.0. Phase 9.0 delivered working loop reasoning, memory traces, and GPT-generated task suggestions. Phase 10.0 will focus on architectural alignment, agentic inference layers, cross-phase context management, and external use case integration.

## âœ… Phase 9.0 Complete

- Loop-based reasoning functional
- Task execution memory trace implemented
- GPT suggestions integrated and promoted to loop structure
- Execution log system persistent and live
- Semantic loop mutation via UI complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 10.0 Objectives

- Render current phase and loop system state in the UI
- Implement Ora System View (phase file + loops + logs + roadmap lineage)
- Begin multi-phase GPT reasoning
- Bridge roadmap to user-defined workstreams
- Refactor loop-scoped logic into reusable reasoning services

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Phase 10.0 initiated following completion of all Phase 9.0 agentic loop goals
