title: Phase 10.0 Wrap-Up â€“ Semantic Execution Slice Complete
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: complete
score: 1.0
tags: [wrapup, reflection, architecture, roadmap, chat, task-system]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: closure
summary: |
  This loop closes Phase 10.0, marking the completion of Oraâ€™s first fully semantic execution slice. The system now supports structured planning, promotion, mutation, logging, scoped chat, and task memory across an architectural hierarchy. All components are stable, test-covered, and traceable.
---

## Purpose

To formally mark the conclusion of Phase 10.0 and establish a clear foundation for Phase 10.1. This includes a reflection on the structural, semantic, and system-level capabilities now fully operational.

## âœ… Outcomes Achieved

- Hierarchical task structure: workstream â†’ program â†’ project â†’ task
- Planning and execution: live planning UI and semantic execution binding
- Task promotion logic with metadata preservation and safe-write
- GPT suggestion integration and traceable origin binding
- Markdown-based memory, logging, and reasoning structure
- Full UI test coverage for task interfaces and loop mutation
- Scoped chat infrastructure: `chat.md` + `/api/chat` + UI ChatPane

## ðŸ”š Notes

Ora now runs its own execution system through its own cognitive architecture. Planning, mutation, reflection, and reasoning are no longer separate concerns â€” they are unified in a traceable, testable slice. The system is ready to evolve into external orchestration and agent-to-agent interaction.
