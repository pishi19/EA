title: "Hierarchical Execution Structure for Workstreams"
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-architecture
status: complete
score: 1.0
tags: [hierarchy, execution-model, workstreams, planning]
created: 2025-08-29
origin: user-request
summary: |
  This loop establishes the full hierarchical folder structure for Ora's semantic execution model under `/runtime/workstreams/`. This creates a nested, traceable system of workstreams, programs, projects, and tasks, each with its own planning, chat, and memory files.
---

## Purpose

To implement a folder and document schema that supports a deeply nested, hierarchical execution model. This structure is essential for tracking context, plans, and memory across different scopes of work, from high-level workstreams down to individual tasks.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Define folder schema under `/runtime/workstreams/` to support nested hierarchy.
- [x] Create `plan.md`, `chat.md`, and `memory.md` at each level.
- [x] Implement the structure for a new `ui-refactor` program.
- [x] Log the creation of the new hierarchy in this file.

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-08-29: Created the full hierarchical execution structure under `/runtime/workstreams/roadmap/`. This includes directories for programs, projects, and tasks, each with their own planning, chat, and memory files, establishing the foundation for the semantic execution model.
- 2025-08-29: Loop created to implement the hierarchical execution structure.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Design hierarchical execution architecture
- [ ] Implement workstream â†’ program â†’ project â†’ task hierarchy
- [ ] Create execution context inheritance patterns
- [ ] Build hierarchical state management system
- [ ] Add cross-level navigation and visualization
- [ ] Implement hierarchical permission and access control
- [ ] Document execution hierarchy patterns
