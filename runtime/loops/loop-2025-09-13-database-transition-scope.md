title: Database Transition Scope â€“ Modeling Structure Beyond Markdown
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: planning
score: 0.8
tags: [database, architecture, qdrant, markdown, vector, structure]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: semantic-boundary
summary: |
  This loop scopes the system boundary between markdown (content), Qdrant (semantic similarity), and a future database layer (structured logic). It defines when and why Ora must evolve to use a relational database for modeling structured hierarchy and supporting rich UI interactions across workstreams, programs, projects, and sources.
---

## Purpose

To prepare Ora's data model for scale and complexity as it grows from file-based loops to multi-source, multi-program coordination. This loop sets architectural boundaries between semantic recall (Qdrant), reasoning surfaces (markdown), and structured modeling (SQL).

---

## ðŸ§  Boundary Model

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Markdown** | Human-readable, GPT-writeable semantic surface |
| **Qdrant** | Vectorized meaning; loop similarity; soft GPT recall |
| **Database** | Task/project/program structure, status filtering, relational links |

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Define entities: Workstream, Program, Project, Task, Loop, Chat
- [ ] Specify fields needed for UI filtering, metadata, and status control
- [ ] Outline migration path from markdown-only to hybrid DB+MD model
- [ ] Define read/write boundaries per surface (GPT, UI, system)
- [ ] Confirm Qdrant's continued role as vector layer
- [ ] Prepare for eventual loop/task embedding into DB with vector+relational sync

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Define database transition architecture and requirements
- [ ] Plan vector and relational database synchronization strategy
- [ ] Design multi-entity relational growth model
- [ ] Establish data migration and transition protocols
- [ ] Create database schema validation framework
- [ ] Implement transition monitoring and rollback procedures
- [ ] Document database transition best practices

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log
