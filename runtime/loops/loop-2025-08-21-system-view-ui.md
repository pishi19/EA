phase: 10.0
workstream: system-ui
status: complete
score: 1.0
tags: [system-view, ui, dashboard, phase-tracking, execution-log]
created: 2025-08-21
origin: phase-10.0-objectives
summary: |
  This loop implements the "System View" UI, a centralized dashboard that provides a real-time overview of Ora's current execution state. It displays the active phase, associated loops, and a unified execution log, serving as the primary source of truth for what Ora is doing.
---

## Purpose

To create a single, comprehensive view that aggregates and displays the state of the Ora system. This dashboard will allow users to quickly understand the current focus of the system, track progress, and review historical actions within the active phase.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Create new page at `/app/system-view/page.tsx`.
- [x] Parse `/runtime/phases/` to find and display the `in_progress` phase.
- [x] Render phase details including title, dates, and objectives.
- [x] List all loop files for the current phase with their metadata.
- [x] Aggregate and display `Execution Log` entries from all active loops.
- [x] Implement a roadmap lineage breadcrumb.
- [x] Use `shadcn/ui` for a clean, modern layout.
- [x] Log the implementation in this file and mark objectives as complete.

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-08-21: Implemented the System View UI. Created a new API endpoint to aggregate phase, loop, and log data. Built a new page at `/system-view` that renders this data using `shadcn/ui` components, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's current state.
- 2025-08-21: Loop created to implement the System View UI. 

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Design system state visualization layout
- [ ] Implement phase file parsing and display
- [ ] Create loop hierarchy and relationship mapping
- [ ] Add roadmap lineage visualization
- [ ] Build interactive navigation between system components
- [ ] Add real-time status indicators for loops and phases
- [ ] Create system health and progress metrics display
