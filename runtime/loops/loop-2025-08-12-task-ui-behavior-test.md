summary: |
  This loop adds Jest-based integration tests for the Task Executor UI, verifying task metadata rendering, task filter behavior, completion triggers, and loop file mutation. It ensures end-to-end confidence that task execution reflects correctly in both UI and loop state.
---

## Purpose

To verify that Ora's Task Executor interface correctly renders loop metadata, allows task filtering, and updates `.md` loop files on user actions. This includes testing both visual and functional logic as defined in `loop-2025-08-02-phase-8-standards.md`.

## âœ… Objectives

- [ ] Confirm task cards render: title, UUID, phase, workstream
- [ ] Ensure dropdown filters update visible tasks
- [ ] Validate button interactions: "Run" (mock) and "Completed"
- [ ] Confirm "Completed" triggers file mutation
- [ ] Confirm execution log is updated in the loop file

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Write integration tests in `TaskExecutor.test.tsx`
    - Render task list from sample loop
    - Confirm loop metadata appears
    - Test workstream and phase filters
    - Simulate "Completed" click
- [ ] Mock file mutation and assert the updated line in `.md` content
- [ ] Mock execution log update with timestamp
- [ ] Snapshot UI state before and after task completion
- [ ] Mark related checklist items as complete in `loop-2025-08-02-phase-8-standards.md` and `loop-2025-08-10-task-mutation-from-ui.md`

---

## ðŸ”„ Execution Plan

1. Scaffold test cases and file mocks
2. Run tests with coverage enabled
3. Confirm mutation and rendering logic
4. Log outcome in this loop and update others as needed
