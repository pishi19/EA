title: Evolution Path from Markdown to Database-Backed Execution
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-integrity
status: in_progress
score: 0.6
tags: [storage-model, evolution, db-transition, md-canonical]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: architectural-consideration
summary: |
  This loop explores the potential evolution from Ora's current `.md` file-based execution model to a future system where database-backed indexing and querying support higher-order performance and multi-agent coordination. Markdown remains the semantic source of truth, but structural queries may be offloaded to a DB when needed.
---

## Purpose

To clarify why `.md` files are currently used as Ora's source of truth, and to define the conditions under which a database layer may be introduced. The goal is to ensure semantic integrity, backward compatibility, and execution traceability ‚Äî even if Ora grows into a more performance-oriented backend.

---

## ‚úÖ Current Model: Markdown-Centric

- `.md` files with frontmatter are legible, versioned, and prompt-readable
- Supports GPT prompting directly from file context
- Mutations are easy to log, inspect, and verify by humans
- Flexible schema allows semantic evolution

---

## üîÅ Future Considerations

| Trigger | Possible DB Advantage |
|---------|------------------------|
| Large-scale queries | Indexed lookup for open tasks, phases, loops |
| Multi-user environments | Concurrent mutation, permissions |
| GPT context compaction | Summarize `.md` into vector embeddings or structured memory |
| UI responsiveness | Instant filtering or trace lookup |

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [ ] Define conditions under which a DB may complement `.md` files
- [ ] Describe models where `.md` remains canonical but DB is a fast index
- [ ] Explore `.md` ‚Üí `sqlite` or `.md` ‚Üí `postgres` hybrid architecture
- [ ] Document GPT dual-read behavior (use `.md` for meaning, DB for filtering)
- [ ] Ensure all mutation pathways preserve markdown traceability
