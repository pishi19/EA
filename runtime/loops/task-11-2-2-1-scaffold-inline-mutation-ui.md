## âœ… Objectives

Create reusable UI components for add, edit, and delete task operations within the filtered roadmap/task view. These components should provide seamless inline editing capabilities while maintaining the existing filter state and UI consistency.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- Create InlineTaskEditor component with add/edit/delete modes
- Design TaskMutationControls for action buttons (add, edit, delete, save, cancel)
- Implement inline form validation for task fields (title, status, tags, etc.)
- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick mutations (Ctrl+N for new, Ctrl+E for edit, Delete for remove)
- Ensure UI controls integrate seamlessly with existing filter components
- Add loading states and error handling for mutation operations
- Create confirmation modals for destructive actions (delete tasks)

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-12-14: Task created as first implementation step for Phase 11.2.2 inline mutation functionality.

- UI components should follow shadcn/ui patterns established in workstream-filter-demo
- Need to maintain filter state during mutation operations
