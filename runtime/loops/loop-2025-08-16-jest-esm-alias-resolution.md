title: Isolate and Resolve Jest Pathing Errors (moduleNameMapper)
phase: 8.4
workstream: system-integrity
status: blocked
score: 0.4
tags: [jest, esm, alias, tsconfig, moduleNameMapper, testing-failure]

origin: test-breakdown
summary: |
  This loop captures the unresolved issue preventing Jest from resolving aliased module paths (e.g., @/components/ui) in the Ora project. It isolates this ESM + Jest + TypeScript resolution problem from the main execution loops so Cursor can skip wasted attempts and future developers can diagnose the issue in isolation.
---

## Purpose

To isolate and systematically diagnose the Jest module path resolution issues that prevent successful testing of Ora's React components, preventing repeated failed attempts in other loops.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [ ] Reproduce alias path failure in minimal test case
- [ ] Document exact error conditions and environment factors
- [ ] Test alternative moduleNameMapper configurations
- [ ] Identify root cause of ESM + TypeScript + Jest incompatibility
- [ ] Provide clear resolution path or workaround documentation
- [ ] Prevent future loops from attempting Jest fixes until resolved

## Context

Jest tests fail due to inability to resolve `@/components/...` and similar alias paths, even with moduleNameMapper configured. The application uses Next.js-style aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`, but Jest (using ESM and modern transform layers) fails to interpret or locate those modules correctly.

## üîß Tasks

- [ ] Reproduce the alias path failure in an isolated Jest test
- [ ] Test alternate configurations of moduleNameMapper using relative paths
- [ ] Consider using Babel transform with absolute path fallback
- [ ] Log reproducible failing configuration
- [ ] Add resolution instructions or a test bypass note for downstream loops
- [ ] Tag Cursor and future prompts to avoid retrying Jest alias fixes until resolved here

---

## üîÅ Dev Notes

This loop prevents recursive attempts by Cursor or GPT to fix Jest pathing issues during test mutation or UI loops. Alias resolution will be treated as a known system error until this loop is closed.
