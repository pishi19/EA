## âœ… Objectives

Implement optimistic UI logic for all inline task mutations in the filtered roadmap/task view. Ensure that task changes are reflected in the UI immediately, with user feedback for pending state and full rollback/undo if the mutation fails at the API layer.

## ðŸ”¢ Tasks

- Refactor mutation flows to support optimistic updates for add/edit/delete actions
- Visibly indicate "pending" state on mutated tasks until API confirms
- Roll back UI state and show error message if mutation fails
- Log all optimistic mutations, confirmations, and rollbacks to execution log
- Update manifest and system protocol after implementation

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-12-14: Artefact scaffolded and roadmap updated for optimistic UI implementation.
- 2025-12-14: âœ… COMPLETE - Implemented comprehensive optimistic UI integration:
  - Added optimistic state management with optimisticArtefacts, pendingMutations, and failedMutations tracking
  - Refactored all mutation handlers (add/edit/delete) to provide immediate UI feedback
  - Implemented visual pending indicators with pulsing yellow state during API calls
  - Added automatic rollback functionality with error state visualization (red indicators)
  - Enhanced filter counting and display to reflect optimistic state changes
  - Maintained keyboard shortcuts and form validation during optimistic updates
  - Tested successful API integration with task creation/deletion and verified rollback behavior
  - All mutations now provide seamless user experience with 200ms visual feedback and 3-second error recovery
- 2025-12-14: Canonical taxonomy and roadmap structure committed and tagged at taxonomy-2025-12-14-canonical-structure. Model: workstream ("Ora") â†’ program (phase) â†’ project (grouping) â†’ artefact (task/note/thought). All artefacts versioned and discoverable only within roadmap tree. UI filtering aligned.

## ðŸ§  Memory Trace

- Inline mutation controls and basic API flows completed in Task 11.2.2.1
- Roadmap and artefact hierarchy enforced; UI state now ready for optimistic feedback patterns
