title: "Task UI Mutation for Workstream Plan"
phase: 10.0
workstream: system-ui
status: complete
score: 1.0
tags: [task-mutation, ui, workstream, planning]
created: 2025-08-27
origin: user-request
summary: |
  This loop implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for tasks within the `workstream_plan.md` file directly from the Ora UI. It provides a rich interface for adding, editing, and managing tasks, with all changes persisting to the source markdown file.
---

## Purpose

To enable seamless management of the `workstream_plan.md` from the UI, transforming it from a static document into a dynamic planning board. This provides a user-friendly interface for task management while maintaining the version-controllable, human-readable markdown file as the source of truth.

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Create a form for adding new tasks with all required fields.
- [x] Render all existing tasks with their metadata (status, source, etc.).
- [x] Implement inline editing for task descriptions and context.
- [x] Add controls for completing, deleting, or rejecting tasks.
- [x] Ensure all UI actions correctly mutate the `workstream_plan.md` file.
- [x] Include a placeholder for future chat integration on each task.
- [x] Log the implementation details in this file.

## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- 2025-08-27: Implemented the full task mutation UI. Created a new Task Board page with a robust set of API endpoints to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks in the workstream plan. The UI supports inline editing, status changes, and task creation via a dialog form.
- 2025-08-27: Loop created to implement task mutation capabilities in the UI. 

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

- [ ] Implement task UI mutation pipeline
- [ ] Create task state synchronization logic
- [ ] Add task history and audit trail
- [ ] Build task conflict resolution system
- [ ] Implement task validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Add real-time task state broadcasting
- [ ] Create task mutation rollback capabilities
