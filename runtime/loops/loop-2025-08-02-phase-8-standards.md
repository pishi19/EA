title: Phase 8 Execution Standards & Verification Framework

summary: |
  This loop formalizes Ora's methodical execution model. It ensures every action ‚Äî from UI builds to agent logic ‚Äî is verified, testable, and logged across loop files, Git commits, and system state. It codifies prior phase practices into mandatory standards for execution integrity.
---

## Purpose

To unify and enforce Ora's execution model using a traceable, testable, and systematic process that covers task mutation, file verification, testing, and Git discipline. This loop sets the standard for all future work across loops and phases.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [x] Establish explicit state synchronization requirements
- [x] Define testable execution steps for all actions
- [x] Implement atomic Git commit discipline
- [x] Create post-action verification framework
- [x] Eliminate silent assumptions in execution
- [x] Ensure loop files remain canonical truth source

---

## üìò Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Explicit State Sync** | Every action must leave a trace in the loop: checklist + log |
| **Testable Steps** | Each execution unit must be testable in isolation |
| **Atomic Git Commits** | Every change must be committed with a clear, semantic message |
| **Post-Action Verification** | Execution is not complete until it is confirmed in both code and loop |
| **No Silent Assumptions** | Prompts and loops must specify all inputs/outputs, never rely on inference |
| **Loop is Truth** | The loop file is the canonical record of intent, progress, and state |

---

## ‚úÖ Methodical Execution Checklist

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| üîÅ Loop Sync | Add/update loop file with `[ ]` task |
| ‚ú® Execute | Perform the code change, script, or UI update |
| ‚úÖ Verify | Confirm the action succeeded (file exists, script runs, UI renders) |
| üßæ Mutate Loop | Mark `[x]` in loop and add to `## Execution Log` |
| üîç Test | Add or run a test (unit, integration, manual check, as appropriate) |
| üîí Git Commit | Use semantic commit message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`) |
| üè∑Ô∏è Git Tag (if phase complete) | Tag commit with phase label (e.g. `phase-8.1-green-complete`) |

---

## üß™ Test Strategy

| Area | Test Type | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| File Mutation | Script or assertion | Loop checklist updates |
| UI Element | Manual or Cypress (future) | "Run" button changes state |
| System Health | Sanity check | Validator script passes |
| Embedding | Programmatic | Qdrant query returns loop ID |
| Prompt Logging | Manual until automated | Prompt execution produces loop + file change |

---

## üîß Tasks

- [ ] Integrate methodical checklist into all loop templates
- [x] Create a validator script to compare loop file tasks with real code state
- [x] Write Git sync script that checks commits against loop UUIDs
- [ ] Retrofit existing loop `loop-2025-08-01-verification-integrity.md` with standards
- [ ] Enforce this model in Phase 8.2+

---

## üîÑ Execution Planning

1. Create validator: `src/system/validate_loop_task_status.py`
2. Create Git audit tool: `src/system/validate_git_task_links.py`
3. Modify loop and phase templates to include this framework
4. Audit past loops for compliance
5. Tag first commit that uses full flow with `standardized-execution-begin`

---

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Created `src/system/validate_git_task_links.py` to enforce semantic linkage in commits.
- 2025-06-07: Loop created to anchor Ora's execution and testing discipline
