title: Phase 8.2 â€“ Yellow Slice Initiation (Contextual Execution)
phase: 8.2
workstream: workstream-ui
status: in_progress
score: 0.85
tags: [yellow-slice, scoped-context, semantic-filtering, agentic-ui, phase-8]
created: 2025-06-07
origin: phase-transition
summary: |
  This loop initiates Phase 8.2 of the Ora system â€” the Yellow Slice. It builds on the Green UI by adding scoped memory and contextual execution. Tasks will now be filtered by project/program, and GPT logic will reflect active semantic context from loops and workstreams.
---

## Purpose

To advance the Task Executor from a static list (Green Slice) to a context-aware execution agent that filters tasks based on the selected project or program. This enables Ora to reason within scoped boundaries and lay the foundation for multi-task memory.

## âœ… Objectives

- [x] Enable project/program-based task filtering in UI
- [x] Integrate loop metadata into task display
- [x] Parse all loop files for contextual task generation
- [x] Add UI dropdowns for workstream and phase filtering
- [ ] Implement scoped GPT calls with contextual memory
- [ ] Establish memory trace scaffolding for task execution

---

## Key Features of Yellow Slice

- Program/Project-based task context
- Loop metadata filters (phase, tag, uuid, workstream)
- Scoped GPT calls (optional, inline for now)
- UI filters for current workstream or source
- Begin memory trace logic: e.g., which loop or session produced each task

---

## ðŸ”§ Tasks

### 1. Context Filters
- [x] Parse all loop files in `/runtime/loops/`
- [x] Extract: `workstream`, `phase`, `tags`, `uuid`
- [x] Generate task contexts from parsed data

### 2. Task Executor Enhancements
- [x] Add UI dropdown or tabs for `Program` / `Project` / `Loop`
- [x] Filter visible tasks based on selected scope
- [x] Display loop metadata inline with task (e.g., source loop title)

### 3. Memory Trace Scaffolding
- [ ] Add per-task `origin_loop_id`
- [ ] Store task run status in a local context map
- [ ] Prepare for persistent store in Phase 8.3

---

## ðŸ”„ Execution Planning

- [x] Create this loop file and embed it into Qdrant
- [x] Update `runtime/phases/phase-8.1.md` to mark closure
- [x] Create `runtime/phases/phase-8.2.md` and list above checklist
- [ ] Scaffold workstream filter logic in TaskExecutor.tsx
