summary: |
  Enhance Ora UI to visibly surface loop type classifications (planning, execution, retrospective) and restore tags display across all views. Add filtering capabilities and semantic grouping to improve loop organization and discoverability.
---

## Purpose

To enhance the Ora UI with visible loop type classifications and restored tag display, making the semantic distinctions between planning loops, execution loops, and retrospectives clearly visible and filterable across all interface components.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- [x] Update data types to include loop `type` field
- [x] Modify roadmap API to extract and expose loop types
- [x] Add loop type display to System View with planning loops sidebar
- [x] Update Phase Document View with type-based grouping
- [x] Implement type badges and restored tags across all loop cards
- [x] Add filtering capabilities for loop types
- [x] Test and validate UI enhancements

## üîß Tasks

### 1. Data Layer Updates
- [x] Add `type` field to `EnrichedLoop` interface
- [x] Update roadmap API to extract `type` from loop frontmatter
- [x] Set default type to 'execution' for backward compatibility

### 2. System View Enhancements
- [x] Add "üìò Planning Loops" sidebar section
- [x] Group planning loops by phase
- [x] Display title, status, score, and linked file name
- [x] Add type filter toggle (All | Planning | Execution | Retrospective)

### 3. Phase Document View Updates
- [x] Group loops into semantic sections:
  - üìò Strategic Documents (type: planning)
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Active Loops (type: execution)  
  - üìì Retrospectives (type: retrospective)
- [x] Add type badges to each loop card
- [x] Restore tags display in loop card UI
- [x] Add type filter toggle

### 4. Global Loop Card Enhancements
- [x] Add type badges with appropriate icons:
  - üìò Planning (blue)
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Execution (green)
  - üìì Retrospective (amber)
- [x] Restore full tags list as pill badges
- [x] Apply to Task Executor, Phase View, and System View

### 5. Testing and Validation
- [x] Test type classification across all views
- [x] Validate filtering functionality
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing loops
- [x] Verify tag display restoration

## üßæ Execution Log

- 2025-06-07: Loop initiated to enhance UI with type classification
- 2025-06-07: Updated data types and API to support loop type extraction
- 2025-06-07: Implemented System View planning loops sidebar with type filtering
- 2025-06-07: Enhanced Phase Document View with semantic grouping by type
- 2025-06-07: Added type badges and restored tags display across all components
- 2025-06-07: Completed Task Executor enhancements with loop type and tags
- 2025-06-07: All UI enhancements completed and tested successfully
- 2025-06-07: Completed UI implementation of loop type classification and tag rendering. All major views (System View, Phase Document View, Task Executor) now support `type:` badges (`planning`, `execution`, `retrospective`), display tags, and provide filtering by type. Strategic loops are now surfaced contextually and separated from operational and retrospective logic.
