# Task 11.3.4 - Roadmap-Driven Filtering Refactor - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive roadmap-driven filtering refactor that transforms the system to use roadmap.md as the canonical source of truth for all programs and projects, with real-time orphan detection and empty branch support.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Roadmap Parser Infrastructure (330+ lines)
- Complete roadmap.md parsing and hierarchy extraction
- Support for programs, projects, and tasks with status tracking
- Fuzzy matching and alignment validation
- Error handling and graceful degradation

### 2. Enhanced Filtering System
- Replaced hardcoded structures with roadmap-driven data
- Dynamic filter options based on roadmap structure
- Real-time orphan detection and display
- Hierarchical filtering with alignment validation

### 3. Tree Navigation Enhancement
- Roadmap hierarchy as source of truth
- Visual indicators for roadmap-defined vs. data nodes
- Empty branch display for complete navigation
- Status badges for programs and projects

### 4. Orphan Detection & Remediation
- Real-time artefact alignment checking
- Visual separation of aligned vs. orphan artefacts
- Detailed reporting with specific issues
- Guided remediation support

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files Created/Modified
- `roadmapParser.ts` - Complete roadmap parsing module
- `useRoadmapHierarchy.ts` - React hook for roadmap state management
- `page.tsx` - Updated main component with roadmap-driven logic
- `TreeNavigation.tsx` - Enhanced tree with roadmap structure
- `roadmapParser.test.ts` - Basic test coverage

### Architecture Benefits
- Single source of truth for hierarchy
- Real-time updates reflecting roadmap changes
- Automatic orphan detection and flagging
- Complete navigation regardless of artefact availability
- Guided artefact creation within valid roadmap entries

## Production Status

âœ… **COMPLETE** - Roadmap-driven filtering now live with:
- Dynamic program/project lists from roadmap.md
- Real-time orphan detection and visual indicators
- Empty branch support for complete navigation
- Artefact alignment validation and remediation guidance
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Next Steps

Resuming **Task 11.3.2 - In-situ Chat & Memory Trace in Tree** with enhanced roadmap-driven foundation now in place.
