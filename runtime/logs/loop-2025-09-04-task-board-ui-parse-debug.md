## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- **Issue:** Tasks were not rendering on the Task Board UI, despite the backend APIs appearing to function correctly. The UI showed an empty list and the debug JSON output was an empty array `[]`.
- **Investigation:**
    1. Added extensive debugging to the `TaskBoard.tsx` component to log the raw API response from `/api/plan-tasks` and render the state as raw JSON.
    2. The debug output confirmed the API was returning an empty array.
    3. Analyzed the `/api/plan-tasks/route.ts` file and discovered a critical bug in the `parsePlan` and `stringifyPlan` functions.
    4. The code was using an escaped newline character (`'\\n'`) instead of the correct literal newline (`'\n'`) to split and join lines. This caused the file parsing to fail silently, resulting in no tasks being found.
- **Resolution:** Corrected all instances of `'\\n'` to `'\n'` in `plan-tasks/route.ts`. This fixed the parsing logic, allowing the backend to correctly read the `workstream_plan.md` file and return the task data.
- **Outcome:** The Task Board now correctly displays all tasks from the plan file. The debugging UI elements have been removed.
