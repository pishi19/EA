## ðŸ§¾ Execution Log

- **Objective:** Isolate all file write operations behind a controlled, validated mutation engine to enforce structural integrity and prevent logic-data drift.

- **Implementation Steps:**
    1. **Created `src/system/mutation-engine.ts`:** A new, centralized module was created to handle all markdown file mutations.
    2. **Implemented Controlled Mutation Functions:** The engine was built with specific, validated functions for all required mutation types:
        - `patchFrontmatter`: For safely updating YAML frontmatter.
        - `appendToSection`: For appending content to a specific markdown section, with validation to ensure the section exists.
        - `replaceInSection`: For replacing content within a specific section.
        - `validateMarkdownSchema`: For verifying that files contain required sections.
    3. **Added Robust Logging:**
        - All successful mutations are now logged to `runtime/logs/mutation-log.json`.
        - All mutation errors are logged to `runtime/logs/mutation-errors.json`.
    4. **Refactored API Routes:** The following API routes were refactored to exclusively use the `mutationEngine` for all file writes, removing direct `fs` calls:
        - `/api/chat`
        - `/api/promote-task`
        - `/api/plan-tasks`
    5. **Established Path Aliases:** Created the `@/system` path alias in `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.ts` to allow for clean, reliable imports of the new engine from the `react-app`.

- **Outcome:** The system's data layer is now significantly more robust and reliable. All markdown file mutations are centralized, validated, and logged, providing a strong defense against the data corruption issues experienced previously. The logic-data boundary is now clearly defined and enforced.
