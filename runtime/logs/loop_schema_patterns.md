# Loop Schema Patterns Analysis

**Generated**: 2025-06-08T07:39:34.849Z  
**Files Analyzed**: 55  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of YAML frontmatter and markdown section patterns across all loop files  

## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals the structural patterns and content organization used across 55 loop files. The findings show a mix of standardized fields (uuid, title, workstream) and flexible content sections, indicating both systematic organization and adaptive documentation practices.

**Key Findings:**
- **27 unique frontmatter fields** ranging from core identifiers to workflow metadata
- **78 unique section headings** covering planning, execution, and reflection content
- **Strong standardization** in identity fields (uuid, title) and workflow fields (status, workstream)
- **Flexible content structure** allowing for domain-specific sections and custom organization

## Integration Recommendations

### High-Value Fields for Source Integration

These fields should be prioritized when integrating external sources (Gmail, Slack, etc.):

- **`title`**: Human-readable title/summary. Critical for search and discovery.
- **`tags`**: Flexible labeling system. Useful for topic-based filtering and semantic search.
- **`uuid`**: Unique identifier for the loop/artefact. Essential for cross-referencing and linking.
- **`created`**: Creation timestamp. Important for chronological ordering and audit trails.
- **`workstream`**: Categorical grouping (system-integrity, workstream-ui, reasoning, memory). Primary filter dimension.
- **`status`**: Current state (planned, in_progress, complete, blocked). Essential for workflow management.
- **`source`**: Specific source system (retrospective, vault, gmail). Key for integration workflows.

### Essential Sections for Structured Content

These sections provide structured frameworks for organizing imported content:

- **üßæ Execution Log**: Historical record of actions taken. Valuable for audit trails and learning.
- **Purpose**: Defines the goal and intent of the loop. Critical for understanding scope and alignment.
- **‚úÖ Objectives**: Structured goals and deliverables. Essential for tracking progress and completion.
- **üîß Tasks**: Actionable work items. Core operational content for execution tracking.
- **‚úÖ Tasks**: Structured goals and deliverables. Essential for tracking progress and completion.
- **üéØ Goal**: High-level objective statement. Similar to Purpose but more action-oriented.
- **2. Execution Log in Loop Files**: Historical record of actions taken. Valuable for audit trails and learning.
- **üîÑ Follow-Up Tasks**: Actionable work items. Core operational content for execution tracking.
- **üéØ Phase 10.0 Objectives**: Structured goals and deliverables. Essential for tracking progress and completion.

### Source-Specific Mapping Recommendations

#### Gmail Integration
- **Map to**: `source: gmail`, `origin: inbox`
- **Extract**: Subject ‚Üí `title`, Thread ID ‚Üí `uuid`, Date ‚Üí `created`
- **Generate**: Tags from sender, labels, and keywords
- **Content**: Email body ‚Üí Purpose section, Action items ‚Üí Tasks section

#### Slack Integration
- **Map to**: `source: slack`, `origin: discussion`
- **Extract**: Channel ‚Üí `workstream`, Thread ID ‚Üí `uuid`, Timestamp ‚Üí `created`
- **Generate**: Tags from channel topic and participants
- **Content**: Messages ‚Üí Chat section, Decisions ‚Üí Objectives section

#### Planning Tool Integration
- **Map to**: `source: planning`, `origin: roadmap`
- **Extract**: Epic/Story ‚Üí `title`, Sprint ‚Üí `phase`, Status ‚Üí `status`
- **Generate**: Tags from labels and components
- **Content**: Description ‚Üí Purpose, Acceptance Criteria ‚Üí Objectives

- `area` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `confidence` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `contacts` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `matched_fields` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `priority` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `program` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `project` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `source_email_ids` (5%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `routed` (4%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `promoted` (4%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `source` (2%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `ambiguous_programs` (2%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `ambiguous_projects` (2%): Consider making required or deprecating
- `type` (2%): Consider making required or deprecating
