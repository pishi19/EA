## Orphaned Artefacts

Files not assigned to canonical workstreams:

- `loop-phase-7.0-gmail-loop-creation.md`: workstream="ora_self_execution"
- `mecca-staging-deploy.md`: workstream="mecca_event_nights"
- `loop-phase-7.1-workstream-ui.md`: workstream="ora_self_execution"
- `loop-2025-08-21-system-view-ui.md`: workstream="system-ui"
- `loop-2025-08-22-phase-document-view.md`: workstream="system-ui"
- `loop-2025-08-27-task-ui-mutation.md`: workstream="system-ui"
- `loop-2025-08-29-hierarchical-execution-structure.md`: workstream="system-architecture"
- `loop-2025-08-31-phase-doc-view-enhancement.md`: workstream="system-ui"

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix files missing required fields (uuid, title, phase, workstream, status)
2. **Priority 2**: Add missing required sections (Purpose, Objectives)
3. **Priority 3**: Standardize workstream values to canonical set
4. **Priority 4**: Ensure all files have proper tags and metadata
5. **Priority 5**: Review orphaned artefacts for proper categorization
