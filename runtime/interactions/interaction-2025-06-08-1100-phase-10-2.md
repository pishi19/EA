## ðŸ’¬ Message

User requested creation of new interaction logging infrastructure:

"Create a new directory at /runtime/interactions/ if it does not already exist. For every new meaningful Ora-user exchange (e.g., chat message, proposal, action in the UI), create a new markdown file in this directory named interaction-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<loopUUID>.md."

Requested structured logging with frontmatter containing:
- uuid: unique interaction identifier
- timestamp: ISO8601 format
- actor: user|ora
- source: origin system (loop, gmail, slack, etc.)
- context: contextual identifier (loop-uuid, phase, task-uuid)
- tags: categorization array

## ðŸ”„ Outcome

âœ… Successfully created `/runtime/interactions/` directory
âœ… Created comprehensive README.md documenting the interaction logging system
âœ… Established file naming convention: `interaction-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<contextUUID>.md`
âœ… Defined structured frontmatter schema with uuid, timestamp, actor, source, context, tags
âœ… Created this sample interaction file demonstrating the structure

**Next Step**: Commit and tag as `phase-10.2-interaction-log-scaffolded` as requested.

**System Impact**: Ora now has structured interaction logging infrastructure for complete audit trail and context-aware traceability across all user-system exchanges.
