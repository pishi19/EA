# Security Audit Report - Pre-Public Release

## Executive Summary

This report documents the security audit performed on the Ora System repository before making it public. **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES** were found and addressed.

## üö® Critical Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. **EXPOSED API KEYS** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: The `.env` file containing actual OpenAI API keys was tracked by Git
- **Risk**: Public exposure would allow unauthorized API usage and potential charges
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed `.env` from Git tracking
  - Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure
  - Created `ENV_SETUP.md` with secure environment variable setup

### 2. **HARDCODED PERSONAL PATHS** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
- **Issue**: 100+ hardcoded paths revealing personal directory structure (`/Users/air/AIR01/`)
- **Risk**: Privacy exposure and potential system information disclosure
- **Files Affected**: Multiple files in `src/` directory
- **Recommendation**: Replace with configurable paths via environment variables

## üîç Security Findings Summary

### Environment Variables Properly Handled ‚úÖ
- OpenAI API keys correctly use `os.getenv()`
- Database paths use environment variables with fallbacks
- Qdrant configuration properly externalized

### Missing Environment Variables ‚ö†Ô∏è
The following should be added to environment configuration:
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT` 
- `SMTP_USERNAME`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- Gmail credentials paths (if used)

### Files Requiring Attention üîß

#### Hardcoded Paths (Sample):
- `src/mcp_server/interface/mcp_memory.py` - Line 4
- `src/generate_logic_patch.py` - Lines 4-5
- `src/gmail/gmail_ingest.py` - Line 8
- `src/utils/email.py` - Line 21
- Many more files (see grep results for full list)

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

1. **Enhanced `.gitignore`**:
   ```
   # Environment variables and secrets
   .env
   .env.*
   *.env
   
   # Credentials and tokens
   credentials/
   *credentials*
   *token*
   *secret*
   *.key
   *.pem
   *.p12
   *.pfx
   
   # Runtime directory with sensitive data
   runtime/credentials/
   runtime/db/
   runtime/logs/
   ```

2. **Created `ENV_SETUP.md`** with secure environment variable setup

3. **Removed sensitive files from tracking**

## üìã Pre-Publication Checklist

- [x] Remove `.env` from Git tracking
- [x] Enhance `.gitignore` for comprehensive protection
- [x] Create environment variable setup documentation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Revoke and regenerate OpenAI API key
- [ ] Replace hardcoded paths with environment variables
- [ ] Review and clean up runtime directory files
- [ ] Consider using git-filter-branch to remove API key from history

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Before Going Public

### MUST DO:
1. **Revoke your current OpenAI API key** at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Generate a new API key** for your local development
3. **Consider using BFG Repo-Cleaner** to remove API key from Git history

### RECOMMENDED:
1. Replace all hardcoded `/Users/air/AIR01/` paths with configurable environment variables
2. Create a separate configuration system for paths
3. Add email configuration to environment variables
4. Review all files in `runtime/` directory for sensitive content

## üîí Security Best Practices Moving Forward

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
2. **Regular key rotation**: Rotate API keys periodically
3. **Path configuration**: Use relative paths or environment variables
4. **Pre-commit hooks**: Consider adding secret scanning to prevent future issues
5. **Separate environments**: Use different keys for development, staging, and production

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION

The repository is **SAFER** but still requires the following before going public:
1. API key revocation and regeneration
2. Hardcoded path cleanup
3. Git history cleaning (recommended)

**Do not make the repository public until these issues are addressed.**
