## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Batch API Endpoint** (`/api/task-mutations/batch/route.ts`)
   - Handles arrays of add/edit/delete operations
   - Processes operations sequentially with individual error handling
   - Returns detailed results with rollback data for undo functionality
   - Supports partial success scenarios (207 status code)

2. **Undo/Redo System** (`lib/use-undo-redo.ts`)
   - React hook for managing undo/redo state
   - Maintains action history with rollback functions
   - Configurable stack size (default: 50 actions)
   - Supports both single and batch operations

3. **Batch UI Controls** (`components/batch-task-controls.tsx`)
   - Multi-select controls with keyboard shortcuts
   - Batch operation buttons (edit, delete, add)
   - Global undo/redo controls with visual feedback
   - Selection state management with visual indicators

4. **Enhanced Task Cards** (`components/batch-task-controls.tsx`)
   - Selectable task cards with checkboxes
   - Visual states: selected, pending, failed
   - Dual-mode rendering (batch vs single)

## üöÄ Key Features

### Multi-Select Functionality
- **Checkboxes**: Individual task selection with visual feedback
- **Select All/None**: Master checkbox with indeterminate state support
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+A`: Toggle select all/none
  - `Ctrl+Z`: Undo last action
  - `Ctrl+Y`/`Ctrl+Shift+Z`: Redo action
  - `Delete`: Batch delete selected items
- **Range Selection**: Shift+click support (planned)
- **Multi-select**: Ctrl+click support (planned)

### Batch Operations
- **Batch Delete**: Delete multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Batch Edit**: Edit multiple tasks (UI placeholder implemented)
- **Batch Add**: Quick add multiple tasks
- **Partial Failure Handling**: Highlight failed operations, continue with successful ones
- **Operation Tracking**: Unique operation IDs for precise error reporting

### Optimistic UI
- **Immediate Feedback**: UI updates before API confirmation
- **Pending States**: Visual indicators during API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback on failure with error highlighting
- **Loading States**: Spinner indicators and disabled controls during operations

### Undo/Redo System
- **Action History**: Maintains stack of reversible actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows last action description and history count
- **Rollback Functions**: Custom rollback logic for each action type
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Standard undo/redo keyboard bindings

## üìä Implementation Statistics

### Code Coverage
- **API Routes**: 1 new endpoint with 11 test cases
- **React Components**: 2 new components with 3 test suites
- **React Hooks**: 1 new hook with complete state management
- **Integration**: Full integration with existing workstream filter demo

### Test Coverage
- **Batch API Tests**: 11 test cases covering all operations and error scenarios
- **Component Tests**: 3 test suites covering rendering and interactions
- **Total Test Cases**: 14 new tests specifically for batch functionality
- **Mock Coverage**: Complete mocking of file system, YAML processing, and external dependencies

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoint Design
```typescript
interface BatchOperation {
  action: 'add' | 'edit' | 'delete';
  taskData?: TaskData;
  taskId?: string;
  operationId: string;
}

interface BatchResult {
  success: boolean;
  results: OperationResult[];
  rollbackData?: any[];
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface UndoRedoAction {
  id: string;
  type: 'single_mutation' | 'batch_mutation';
  timestamp: string;
  description: string;
  rollbackData: any;
  rollbackFunction?: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Workstream Filter Demo**: Seamless integration with existing filtering
- **Task Mutation Controls**: Maintains compatibility with single operations
- **Optimistic UI**: Leverages existing optimistic update patterns
- **Canonical Schema**: Maintains alignment with established taxonomy

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### API Testing
- **Batch Operations**: Add, edit, delete operations in batches
- **Mixed Operations**: Combinations of different operation types
- **Error Handling**: Partial failures, validation errors, file system errors
- **Edge Cases**: Empty operations, malformed requests, missing data

### Component Testing
- **Selection Logic**: Multi-select state management
- **Visual States**: Pending, failed, selected states
- **User Interactions**: Checkbox clicks, button actions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Undo/redo, select all, delete operations

### Integration Testing
- **Mode Switching**: Single vs batch mode transitions
- **Filter Preservation**: Selection state across filter changes
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI consistency during API operations
- **Error Recovery**: Rollback and error state handling

## üîç Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Batch Edit UI**: Form implementation pending (placeholder exists)
2. **Range Selection**: Shift+click not yet implemented
3. **Ctrl+Click**: Individual multi-select not yet implemented
4. **Redo Logic**: Basic implementation, could be enhanced with operation replay
5. **Persistence**: Undo history is session-only (not persisted)

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Selections**: No virtualization for very large datasets
- **Memory Usage**: Undo stack size limited to 50 actions by default
- **API Calls**: Sequential processing of batch operations (not parallel)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Selection**: Range and individual multi-select
2. **Batch Edit Form**: Rich UI for editing multiple tasks
3. **Operation Queuing**: Offline support with operation queuing
4. **History Persistence**: Save/restore undo history across sessions
5. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent batch operation execution
