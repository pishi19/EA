# Ora Architecture Decisions

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Separate Route vs Integration
**Decision**: Create Ora as a separate route (`/ora`) rather than integrating into existing admin
**Rationale**: 
- Preserves existing admin functionality
- Allows independent development and testing
- Can be integrated later if desired
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Database Design
**Decision**: Create new tables specifically for Ora functionality
**Rationale**:
- `ora_conversations`: Track full conversation history for context
- `workstream_constitutions`: Store structured requirements separate from workstreams
- `ora_patterns`: Enable learning and improvement over time
**Alternative considered**: Extending existing workstream table
**Why rejected**: Would complicate existing schema and potentially break functionality

### 3. API Structure
**Decision**: Create dedicated `/api/ora/*` endpoints
**Rationale**:
- Clear namespace separation
- Independent rate limiting and security
- Easier to test and maintain
**Alternative considered**: Reusing existing endpoints
**Why rejected**: Would mix concerns and complicate existing API

### 4. UI Architecture
**Decision**: Component-based architecture with clear separation
**Rationale**:
- Reusable components
- Easy to test individually
- Clear data flow
- Follows existing project patterns

### 5. State Management
**Decision**: Use React hooks and Context API
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing codebase
- No need for heavy state management library
- Simple and performant for this use case
**Alternative considered**: Redux or Zustand
**Why rejected**: Overkill for current requirements

### 6. LLM Integration
**Decision**: Use OpenAI API with gpt-4
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated in the project
- Good balance of capability and cost
- Well-documented API
**Future consideration**: Could add support for other models

### 7. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: User-friendly messages with detailed logging
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging in production
- Security through obscurity for errors

### 8. Testing Approach
**Decision**: Test-driven development with coverage requirements
**Rationale**:
- Ensures reliability
- Documents expected behavior
- Catches regressions early
**Coverage target**: 80% minimum

### 9. Pattern Learning
**Decision**: Simple occurrence counting with examples
**Rationale**:
- Easy to implement and understand
- Can be enhanced later with ML
- Provides immediate value

### 10. Security Model
**Decision**: Inherit existing RBAC with additional checks
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with platform security
- No need to reinvent authentication
- Leverages existing audit system

## Future Considerations

1. **Multi-language support**: Currently English only
2. **Advanced ML patterns**: Could use embeddings for better pattern matching
3. **Voice interface**: Could add speech-to-text for accessibility
4. **Mobile optimization**: Current focus is desktop-first
5. **Batch operations**: Could allow creating multiple workstreams
