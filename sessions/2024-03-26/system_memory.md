## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing comprehensive logging and documentation improvements across the EA system. The changes were driven by the need for better system observability, error tracking, and maintainability.

## Key Decisions and Rationale

### 1. Logging Implementation
**Decision**: Implement structured logging across core components
**Why**:
- Need for better system observability
- Improved error tracking and debugging
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Better performance tracking

**Impact**:
- Affects core system components
- Changes error handling patterns
- Improves debugging capabilities
- Enhances system monitoring

### 2. Documentation Structure
**Decision**: Create comprehensive documentation hierarchy
**Why**:
- Need for clear system understanding
- Better onboarding for new developers
- Improved maintainability
- Clearer system architecture

**Impact**:
- New documentation structure
- Enhanced system overview
- Better troubleshooting guides
- Improved component documentation
