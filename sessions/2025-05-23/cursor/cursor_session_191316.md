**User** (2025-05-23T19:13:10.539384):
The dashboard is loading slowly, especially with large datasets

**Assistant** (2025-05-23T19:13:12.544399):
Let's analyze the performance bottlenecks. Can you share the current load times?

**User** (2025-05-23T19:13:15.547097):
It takes about 5 seconds to load 1000 sessions

**Assistant** (2025-05-23T19:13:16.552181):
We can optimize the data loading and caching. I'll implement pagination and lazy loading.
